  "response": "1. Quality Issue\n   - Explanation: The code does not check whether the threads in the `workers` vector are joinable before calling `join()`.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: If any thread in the `workers` vector is not joinable, calling `t.join()` will result in a runtime error.\n   - How to fix it: Before each join call, check if the thread is joinable by using `if (t.joinable())`.\n\n2. Quality Issue\n   - Explanation: The lambda functions in the threads do not have explicit return types specified.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: While the compiler can deduce the return type, specifying it explicitly improves code clarity and maintainability, especially in more complex functions.\n   - How to fix it: Add an explicit return type to the lambda functions, e.g., `[]() -> void {}`.\n\n3. Quality Issue\n   - Explanation: The use of `async(std::launch::async,...)` directly is highlighted as potentially non-optimal, as it may not use a thread pool effectively.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: This can lead to inefficiency by creating new threads unnecessarily.\n   - How to fix it: Use a well-managed thread pool, either by a standard library or a third-party library, to manage async operations if used frequently.\n\n4. Quality Issue\n   - Explanation: The comment `// do some other work` in the busy-wait loop doesn't actually perform any work other than sleeping.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: This comment is misleading, suggesting that something substantial should be taking place in the loop.\n   - How to fix it: Clarify the comment to reflect that the loop is primarily for waiting and sleeping. Alternatively, if practical, perform some actual computation if the context allows.\n\n5. Quality Issue\n   - Explanation: The use of namespaces and the separation of responsibilities in a global main function could be more structured.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: Having all the thread-related logic in the `main()` function reduces readability and maintainability.\n   - How to fix it: Break down the `main()` function into smaller, well-named functions that perform specific tasks, such as `runThreads()`, `manageFutures()`, and `useParallelAlgorithms()`.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 5",
