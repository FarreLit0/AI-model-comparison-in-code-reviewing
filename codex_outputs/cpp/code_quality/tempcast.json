Explanation:\n   - What the issue is: The function does not check for division by zero before performing division operations.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: Division by zero leads to undefined behavior or runtime errors.\n   - How to fix it: Add a condition to check if the divisor is zero before performing the division, and handle the error accordingly.\n\nCategory: BUG\n2. Explanation:\n   - What the issue is: A variable is used without being initialized.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: Using uninitialized variables can lead to unpredictable behavior or runtime crashes.\n   - How to fix it: Ensure all variables are properly initialized before use.\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n1. Explanation:\n   - What the issue is: Poorly named variables that do not convey their purpose or context clearly.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: This makes the code harder to read and understand for other developers or future maintainers.\n   - How to fix it: Use meaningful and descriptive names that clearly indicate the purpose of the variables.\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n2. Explanation:\n   - What the issue is: Inconsistent indentation and formatting throughout the code.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: Poor formatting can affect readability and make the code harder to maintain.\n   - How to fix it: Apply consistent coding standards and format the code uniformly, using tools or IDE features for automatic formatting if necessary.\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n3. Explanation:\n   - What the issue is: Lack of comments or documentation in complex sections of the code.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: This can lead to misunderstandings or misinterpretations by other developers or when revisiting the code after some time.\n   - How to fix it: Add comments explaining complex logic or important sections, and consider adding more comprehensive documentation.\n\nTotal bugs: 2\nTotal quality issues: 3",
