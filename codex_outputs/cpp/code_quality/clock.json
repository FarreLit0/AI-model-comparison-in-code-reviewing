  "response": "1. Category: BUG\n   - The issue is the incorrect use of `static_cast<float>`.\n   - It\u2019s a problem because `cpu_time_used` is declared as `double`, and the cast to `float` could lead to unnecessary precision loss.\n   - Fix it by using `static_cast<double>` or simply removing the cast since integer division already results in `double`.\n\n2. Category: BUG\n   - Discrepancy in variable usage for `d3` calculation.\n   - The problem is that `d3` is incorrectly calculated as `end2 - start2`, when it should be `end3 - start3`.\n   - Fix it by changing the calculation of `d3` to `auto d3 = end3 - start3`.\n\n3. Category: QUALITY\n   - The issue is the redundant comment `// usually nanoseconds`.\n   - It\u2019s a problem because it can mislead readers if the actual default duration is different; comments should not be assumptions.\n   - Fix it by specifying `std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::nanoseconds>` explicitly if the unit is essential.\n\n4. Category: QUALITY\n   - The issue is an unused include for `<ctime>` and incorrect comments like `[...] Modern C++ System Clock`.\n   - It\u2019s a problem because it clutters the code with untracked and misleading documentation.\n   - Fix it by removing unnecessary includes and refining comments to accurately describe block functionality.\n\n5. Category: QUALITY\n   - The use of placeholder variables with `_` like `milliseconds_as_int_`.\n   - It\u2019s a problem because it doesn\u2019t conform to common naming conventions and can decrease code readability.\n   - Fix it by renaming variables to more meaningful names, such as `milliseconds_duration`.\n\n6. Category: QUALITY\n   - The block comments with square brackets, like `[... Steady Modern C++ Steady Clock]`.\n   - It\u2019s a problem because it introduces an unconventional commenting style, which could be confusing.\n   - Fix it by using standard `//...` or `/*...*/` comment styles.\n\n7. Category: QUALITY\n   - The issue is the redundant example blocks for clock measurements (`system_clock`, `steady_clock`).\n   - It\u2019s a problem because the code duplicates a structure with negligible differences, which is not DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).\n   - Fix it by creating a function to generalize elapsed time measurement and print it for any clock type used.\n\nTotal bugs: 2  \nTotal quality issues: 5",
