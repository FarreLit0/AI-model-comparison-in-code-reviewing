Category: BUG\n- Explanation:\n  - What the issue is: In the function `wrong_delete_operator`, a single element allocated with `new` is being deallocated with `delete[]`.\n  - Why it\u2019s a problem: This leads to undefined behavior as `delete[]` should only be used for arrays allocated with `new[]`.\n  - How to fix it: Replace `delete[] buff;` with `delete buff;`.\n\n2. Category: BUG\n- Explanation:\n  - What the issue is: The function `memleak` allocates memory dynamically but doesn\u2019t free it, causing memory leaks.\n  - Why it\u2019s a problem: Memory leaks can lead to increased memory usage and potential application crashes over time as resources are not released.\n  - How to fix it: Add `delete number;`, `free(buff);`, and `delete[] number_array;` before exiting the function.\n\n3. Category: BUG\n- Explanation:\n  - What the issue is: The function `static_array_out_of_bounds` accesses an array out of bounds with `array[11]`.\n  - Why it\u2019s a problem: Accessing out-of-bounds indices leads to undefined behavior, potentially causing data corruption or crashes.\n  - How to fix it: Ensure indices are within the array bounds, e.g., `int i = 9;`.\n\n4. Category: BUG\n- Explanation:\n  - What the issue is: The function `dynamic_array_out_of_bounds` reads from an array out of bounds with `array[11]`.\n  - Why it\u2019s a problem: Same as above, accessing out-of-bounds memory causes undefined behavior.\n  - How to fix it: Ensure indices are within the allocated range, e.g., `int i = 9;`.\n\n5. Category: BUG\n- Explanation:\n  - What the issue is: The function `dereferencing_null_pointer` dereferences a NULL pointer.\n  - Why it\u2019s a problem: Dereferencing a NULL pointer leads to undefined behavior and can crash the program.\n  - How to fix it: Initialize the pointer with a valid address or check for NULL before dereferencing.\n\n6. Category: BUG\n- Explanation:\n  - What the issue is: In the function `dereferencing_null_pointer_complex`, after a NULL check and `goto`, it unconditionally dereferences a potentially NULL pointer.\n  - Why it\u2019s a problem: It leads to undefined behavior if `obj` is NULL.\n  - How to fix it: Remove or modify the `goto` logic to prevent dereferencing a NULL pointer.\n\n7. Category: BUG\n- Explanation:\n  - What the issue is: The function `bad_free` uses `free` on a memory allocated with `new` and `delete` on a memory allocated with `malloc`.\n  - Why it\u2019s a problem: Mismatched allocators and deallocators lead to undefined behavior and potential memory corruption.\n  - How to fix it: Use `delete n;` and `free(m);`.\n\nTotal bugs: 7\nTotal quality issues: 0",
