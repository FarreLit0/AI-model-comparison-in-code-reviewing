  "response": "1. Issue: Assignment instead of comparison\nExplanation: The code uses the assignment operator '=' instead of the equality comparison operator '==' when checking if the sides of the triangle are equal. This results in side variables being assigned new values instead of being compared.\nFix: Change all instances of '=' to '=='. For example, in the statement \"if ($a = $b && $b = $c)\", it should be \"if ($a == $b && $b == $c)\".\n\n2. Issue: Deep nesting\nExplanation: The nested if-else structure can lead to less readable code, especially if the logic expands in the future.\nFix: Change the nested structure to a series of independent if statements or refactor the logic for clarity.\n\n3. Issue: Magic strings\nExplanation: The strings \"Invalid\", \"Equilateral\", \"Isosceles\", and \"Scalene\" are magic strings, meaning they appear out of context and can lead to errors if mistyped elsewhere in the code.\nFix: Define constants at the beginning of the function for these strings to improve maintainability and readability.\n\n4. Code style: Inconsistent use of brackets\nExplanation: The code uses a mix of brackets for the if statement blocks (e.g., sometimes omitted for single-line statements).\nFix: For consistency and better readability, always use braces {} for all if blocks, even if they are one-liners.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 3",
