Category: BUG\n   - Explanation:\n     - What the issue is: The function `isStrongPassword` returns `true` if the password is less than 8 characters or does not contain an uppercase letter, which is contrary to the typical expectation of indicating a strong password.\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: The function should return `false` for weak passwords and `true` for strong passwords according to the naming convention. Returning `true` for weak passwords may lead to logic errors where the function is used.\n     - How to fix it: Change the logic such that the function returns `false` if any of the conditions for a strong password are not met and `true` otherwise. For example:\n       ```php\n       return strlen($password) >= 8 && preg_match(\"/[A-Z]/\", $password);\n       ```\n\n2. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - What the issue is: The regular expression checking only for uppercase letters does not cover all criteria of a strong password, such as the inclusion of numbers and special characters.\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: A strong password is typically considered to have a minimum length, a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special symbols. This code only checks the length and the presence of uppercase letters, which might be misleading.\n     - How to fix it: Enhance the password criteria to check for additional conditions (e.g., presence of digits and special characters). For instance, expand the regular expression to include checks for digits and special characters.\n\nTotal bugs: 1  \nTotal quality issues: 1",
