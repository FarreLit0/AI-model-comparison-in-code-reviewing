  "response": "1. Issue: Logic Bug in Function Name\n   Explanation: The function name `isStrongPassword` suggests it will return `true` for a strong password, but the logic inside returns `true` for passwords that do not meet certain criteria (i.e., weak passwords).\n   Why it's a problem: This can confuse users of the function, as they may expect `true` to indicate a strong password when it actually indicates a weak one.\n   How to fix it: Either rename the function to something like `isWeakPassword` or change the return values to ensure `true` indicates a strong password.\n   \n2. Issue: Missing Validation Criteria for Strong Passwords\n   Explanation: The function only checks if the password is at least 8 characters long and contains an uppercase letter. It does not check for other typical strong password criteria such as the presence of numbers, lowercase letters, or special characters.\n   Why it's a problem: The function does not fully ensure a strong password as per common standards.\n   How to fix it: Add additional checks for the presence of at least one number, one lowercase letter, and one special character.\n\n3. Issue: Use of Magic Number\n   Explanation: The number `8` is used directly in the function to indicate the minimum password length without any explanation.\n   Why it's a problem: Magic numbers decrease code readability and maintainability because it's not immediately clear why this number was chosen or what it represents.\n   How to fix it: Define a constant like `define(\"MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH\", 8)` and use that in the function.\n\n4. Issue: Inconsistent Return Logic\n   Explanation: The function returns `true` when the password is weak based on certain conditions but defaults to `false` without clearly indicating why.\n   Why it's a problem: It can make the code harder to understand and extend in the future.\n   How to fix it: Explicitly indicate that the password is strong by organizing conditions to check all factors and then return `true` only when the password meets all required criteria.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 3",
