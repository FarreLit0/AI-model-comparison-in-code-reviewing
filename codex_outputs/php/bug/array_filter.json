  "response": "1. Category: BUG\n   - The issue is that the code attempts to assign a single value to `$result` when `$val` is not greater than `$limit`.\n   - This is a problem because `$result` is intended to be an array that collects multiple values. The current logic overwrites `$result` with a single value instead of appending.\n   - To fix it, remove the `else` clause entirely or change it to simply skip adding `$val` to `$result`.\n\n2. Category: CODE QUALITY\n   - The issue is the lack of braces `{}` for the `if` and `else` statements.\n   - This is problematic as it can lead to errors when modifying the code, reducing readability and increasing the likelihood of bugs.\n   - To fix it, add braces `{}` to both `if` and `else` code blocks to ensure clarity and future-proof against mistakes during maintenance.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 1",
