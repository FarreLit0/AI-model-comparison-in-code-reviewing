Category: BUG\n   - The issue is the use of the assignment operator `=` instead of the equality operator `==` in the condition.\n   - It's a problem because it assigns the values instead of comparing them, leading to the condition always being true since non-empty strings are considered truthy.\n   - To fix it, change the assignment operators `=` to equality operators `==` in the if condition: `if ($user == $validUser && $pass == $validPass)`.\n\n2. Category: QUALITY\n   - The issue is hardcoding credentials within the function.\n   - It\u2019s a problem because it is insecure and limits flexibility for credential changes or storage methods.\n   - To fix it, consider retrieving credentials from a secured storage like an environment variable or configuration file.\n\n3. Category: QUALITY\n   - The issue is poor function parameter naming ($user, $pass).\n   - It\u2019s a problem because it reduces code readability and does not clarify the context.\n   - To fix it, rename the parameters to more descriptive names, such as `$username` and `$password`.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 2",
