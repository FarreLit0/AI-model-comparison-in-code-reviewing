  "response": "1. Category: BUG\n   Explanation:\n   - The conversion formula is generally correct, but the additional string formatting in the return statement can lead to unintended issues if numerical values are required for further computation.\n   - Returning a string that includes a unit (e.g., \" F\") can hinder further numerical operations on the Fahrenheit temperature value and introduces a potential for errors if this function is expected to return a numerical type. \n   - To fix this, the function should return just the numerical value. If including units is necessary, it should be done outside the function.\n\n2. Category: QUALITY\n   Explanation:\n   - The function name `toFahrenheit` does not indicate the expected input type explicitly.\n   - Clear and descriptive naming helps in understanding what the function does, improves code readability, and lowers the chance for misuse. \n   - A revised function name such as `convertCelsiusToFahrenheit` can provide clarity by indicating both the conversion direction and the type of conversion.\n\n3. Category: QUALITY\n   Explanation:\n   - The function does not include any type checks or error handling for situations when a non-numeric value is passed as an argument.\n   - Without type checking, the function's behavior is unpredictable and could lead to runtime errors or warnings if a non-numeric type is passed in.\n   - To improve reliability, add input validation to check if the provided argument is numeric and handle cases when it is not, for example using `is_numeric()` or type declarations if using PHP 7 or above.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 2",
