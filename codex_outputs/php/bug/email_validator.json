  "response": "1. Issue: Incorrect usage of `strpos`.\n   Explanation: The `strpos` function returns `false` when the character is not found, but it also returns `0` if the character is found at the beginning, which is considered false in a boolean context.\n   Problem: Emails that have \"@\" or \".\" as the first character will incorrectly return `false`.\n   Fix: Use `=== false` to explicitly check if the character is not found. \n   Example: `if (strpos($email, \"@\") === false) { ... }`\n\n2. Issue: Separate checks for \"@\" and \".\".\n   Explanation: The current checks don't ensure that both characters are present in a valid format (e.g., domain should typically have a period after the @ symbol).\n   Problem: This may allow invalid formats like \"email@com\".\n   Fix: Use a regular expression to ensure a valid email format.\n\n3. Issue: Poor validation logic for email format.\n   Explanation: The logic only checks if \"@\" and \".\" are present but doesn't confirm a valid email structure.\n   Problem: Allows invalid email formats that include \"some@randomtext\" without a domain part.\n   Fix: Implement a more robust validation using regular expressions like `filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)`.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 3",
