  "response": "1. Issue: Incorrect comparison operator in if condition.\n   Explanation: The code uses the assignment operator (=) instead of the equality operator (==) in the if condition.\n   Problem: This causes the variable `$age` to always be assigned the value `18`, and the condition to always evaluate to true, returning true regardless of the input.\n   Fix: Replace the assignment operator with the equality operator `==` as follows: `if ($age == 18)`.\n\n2. Issue: Logic flaw in age validation.\n   Explanation: The current implementation only considers age 18 as an adult.\n   Problem: Typically, adulthood is defined as being 18 years or older, rather than exactly 18.\n   Fix: Modify the condition to check if the age is 18 or greater: `if ($age >= 18)`.\n\nTotal bugs: 2\nTotal quality issues: 0",
