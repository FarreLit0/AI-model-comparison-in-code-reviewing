  "response": "1. Category: BUG\n   - Explanation:\n     - The issue is an incorrect use of the assignment operator `=` instead of the comparison operator `==` or `===`.\n     - This causes the function to always return `true` since `$age = 18` assigns the value 18 to `$age`, which is a truthy value in PHP.\n     - To fix it, replace `$age = 18` with `$age == 18` or `$age === 18` to correctly compare the value.\n\n2. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - The logic and return statements are unnecessarily verbose.\n     - It's a problem as it decreases code readability and maintainability by complicating the simple logic.\n     - To fix it, simplify the function to: `return $age === 18;`, which directly returns the boolean result of the comparison.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 1",
