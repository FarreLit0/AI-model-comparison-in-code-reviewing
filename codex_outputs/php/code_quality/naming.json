  "response": "1. Issue: Function Naming\n   Explanation: The function name \"dOaCt\" lacks clarity and follows an inconsistent case style. It doesn't describe what the function does, which reduces readability and maintainability of the code.\n   Solution: Rename the function to something more descriptive and use consistent naming conventions, such as \"addNumbers\". This clarifies the function's purpose.\n\n2. Issue: Meaningless Variable Naming\n   Explanation: The variables $x, $y, and $z are not descriptive, making the code less readable and understandable.\n   Solution: Rename the variables to more descriptive names such as $firstNumber, $secondNumber, and $sum to clarify the role of each variable.\n\nThere are no logic or functional bugs in the code; it performs the task of adding two numbers correctly and returning the result.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 2",
