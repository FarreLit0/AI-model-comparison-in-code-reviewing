Issue: The parameter name `$n` is not descriptive. \n   Explanation: Using non-descriptive variable names can make the code difficult to understand, especially for someone who may not be familiar with the function or its context. \n   How to Fix: Rename the parameter `$n` to something more descriptive, such as `$number`.\n\n2. Issue: Missing type hint for the parameter `$n`.\n   Explanation: PHP supports type hinting which can enforce that the function is working with the intended data type. Without it, there may be unexpected behavior if a non-integer value is passed.\n   How to Fix: Add an integer type hint for the parameter: `function is_even(int $number)`.\n\n3. Issue: The function does not validate the input.\n   Explanation: The function assumes that the input is always a valid integer, but without validation, there is potential for errors if invalid data is passed.\n   How to Fix: Consider adding validation to handle cases where the input is not an integer, or document clearly that the function expects an integer argument.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 3",
