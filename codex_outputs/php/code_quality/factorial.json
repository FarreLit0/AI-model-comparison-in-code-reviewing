  "response": "1. Missing base case for negative numbers:\n   What the issue is: The function does not handle negative numbers, leading to potential infinite recursion and a stack overflow error.\n   Why it's a problem: Calling factorial with a negative number will cause the recursion to never reach a base case, resulting in an error.\n   How to fix it: Add a condition to handle negative inputs by returning an error message or throwing an exception.\n\n2. Inconsistency in return syntax:\n   What the issue is: The return statement for the base case does not use braces, while the other return statement does involve additional logic that goes beyond a simple line.\n   Why it's a problem: Although it won't cause a functional issue, it's a readability problem. Consistently using braces improves readability and maintainability.\n   How to fix it: Use braces consistently for all if statements, even if they contain only a single line.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 1",
