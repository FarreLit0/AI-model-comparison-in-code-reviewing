  "response": "1. Magic number in the discount function:\nWhat the issue is: The number 0.85 is a magic number in the code.\nWhy it's a problem: Magic numbers can make the code difficult to understand and maintain because it's not clear what the number represents without additional context. It hardcodes the discount rate directly into the function.\nHow to fix it: Define a named constant to represent the discount rate. This improves readability and makes it easy to update the discount rate in the future. For example:\n```\ndefine('DISCOUNT_RATE', 0.85);\nfunction discount($price) {\n    return $price * DISCOUNT_RATE;\n}\n```\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 1",
