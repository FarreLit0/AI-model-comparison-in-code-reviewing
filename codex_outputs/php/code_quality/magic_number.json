Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - The use of a \"magic number\" (0.85) is present in the code.\n     - Magic numbers are problematic because they are hard-coded values without context, which can lead to misunderstandings and make the code less maintainable.\n     - To fix this, replace the magic number with a named constant or variable that describes its purpose, for example: \n       ```php\n       <?php\n       function discount($price) {\n           $discountRate = 0.85;\n           return $price * $discountRate;\n       }\n       ?>\n       ```\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 1",
