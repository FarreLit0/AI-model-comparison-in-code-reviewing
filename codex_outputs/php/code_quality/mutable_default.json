  "response": "1. Category: BUG\n   - Explanation:\n     - What the issue is: The function `append_value` has a default argument for `$list` set to `null` with a reference. This causes unexpected behavior because each time the function is called without a second argument, a new array will be created and will not retain previously appended values.\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: The function does not accumulate values across calls unless a specific list is passed, defeating the purpose of using a reference when intended to accumulate in a previously defined or external list.\n     - How to fix it: Remove the default value for the reference parameter and require that the array to which values will be appended must be explicitly passed in each call.\n\n2. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - What the issue is: The use of a reference with a default value is a bad practice and can lead to confusion. It is generally not clear to the reader how the function should be used concerning accumulating results.\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: This approach can lead to subtle bugs and misunderstandings regarding how data is accumulated over multiple function calls.\n     - How to fix it: Require an explicit list to be passed to the function, or use a pattern that clearly manages state, like an object.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 1",
