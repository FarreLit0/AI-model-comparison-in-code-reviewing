  "response": "1. Issue: Missing type check.\n   Explanation: The function does not verify if all elements in the input array `$numbers` are actually numbers. If non-numeric values are present, `array_sum` will likely fail to produce the intended result, leading to potential unexpected behavior.\n   Solution: Add a check within the function to ensure all elements in the `$numbers` array are numeric, or ensure that the input is pre-validated.\n\n2. Issue: Naming convention.\n   Explanation: The naming convention for functions in PHP can vary, but it's often recommended to follow either camelCase or snake_case consistently. Here, `calculate_average` follows snake_case, which is fine but should be consistent with the rest of the codebase.\n   Solution: If the rest of the codebase uses camelCase, you might change the function name to `calculateAverage`.\n\n3. Issue: Implicit return type.\n   Explanation: The function returns an integer or float depending on the input, which may lead to unnoticed type issues. PHP is a loosely typed language, but for better code quality, defining the return type can improve reliability and code understanding.\n   Solution: Declare the return type explicitly by changing the function signature to `function calculate_average(array $numbers): float`.\n\n4. Issue: Magic number.\n   Explanation: Returning 0 for an empty array is currently a magic number. This can lead to confusion as to why 0 is chosen as a default value.\n   Solution: Define a named constant or add a comment explaining why 0 is chosen as the default return value for an empty array.\n\n5. Issue: Lack of whitespace.\n   Explanation: The code lacks sufficient whitespace, making it less readable. Good practices dictate that spaces should be used after commas.\n   Solution: Add spaces after the commas in function calls for increased readability.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 4",
