CamelCase or all lowercase without underscores are more common and can improve readability.\n   - Consistent naming conventions help with code maintainability and readability.\n   - Rename the function to `calculateAverage` to follow the CamelCase naming convention or `calculateaverage` if preferring all lowercase, depending on the project's naming standards.\n\n2. Explanation:\n   - The return statement is on the same line as the if condition.\n   - While this is not a bug, it can reduce readability, especially in more complex functions or when more conditions are involved.\n   - Use a block format for the if statement. For example:\n     ```\n     if (empty($numbers)) {\n         return 0;\n     }\n     ```\n     This makes the code more readable and maintainable.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 2",
