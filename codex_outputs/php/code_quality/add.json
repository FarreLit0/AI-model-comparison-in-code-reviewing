Code quality issue\n   - The issue is the lack of type hinting and return type declaration.\n   - This is a problem because it doesn't clearly communicate the expected types of the function parameters or the return type, potentially leading to misuse or errors when the function is called with unexpected types.\n   - To fix it, add type hints and a return type declaration: `function add(int $a, int $b): int`.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 1",
