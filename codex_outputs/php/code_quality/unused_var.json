  "response": "1. Category: QUALITY\n   Explanation:\n   - What the issue is: The variable `$unused` is declared but never used.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: Declaring variables that are not used adds unnecessary clutter to the code, making it harder to read and maintain.\n   - How to fix it: Remove the declaration of the `$unused` variable.\n\n2. Category: QUALITY\n   Explanation:\n   - What the issue is: The function `ask_number` is not doing any input validation.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: Without input validation, the function could accept invalid inputs which may cause issues in subsequent operations that depend on numerical values.\n   - How to fix it: Add input validation to ensure that the value returned by the function is a valid number. For example, use a loop to repeatedly ask for input until a valid number is entered.\n\n3. Category: QUALITY\n   Explanation:\n   - What the issue is: The function name `ask_number` is somewhat ambiguous regarding its actual behavior.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: A function name should clearly convey what the function does. In this case, while it seems to prompt for a number, the current name does not specify if it returns an integer, float, or any type of numeric input.\n   - How to fix it: Consider renaming the function to something more descriptive, such as `get_user_input_number`.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 3",
