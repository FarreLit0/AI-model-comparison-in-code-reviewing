  "response": "1. Category: BUG\n   - Explanation:\n     - The code snippet contains an incorrect assignment within the `greet` function: `if (greeting = undefined)`.\n     - This is a common mistake where the assignment operator `=` is used instead of the equality operator `==` or the strict equality operator `===`.\n     - This should be corrected to `if (greeting === undefined)` to properly check if `greeting` is `undefined` rather than assigning `undefined` to it.\n\n2. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - The variables `name` and `greeting` are unnecessarily reassigned to constant variables within the `greet` method.\n     - This redundancy leads to more code with no benefit, as `this.name` and `this.greeting` can be directly used.\n     - Remove the redundant variable assignments and directly use `this.name` and `this.greeting`.\n\n3. Category: BUG\n   - Explanation:\n     - The `greet` method contains a template string syntax error. It uses double quotes instead of backticks.\n     - Template literals in JavaScript should be enclosed with backticks (`` `${}` ``).\n     - Correct it to `return \\`${greeting}, ${name}!\\`;` for the template literal to work properly.\n\n4. Category: BUG\n   - Explanation:\n     - The Greeter instance `g` is instantiated incorrectly, providing only one argument (\"Hi\"), while the constructor expects two parameters.\n     - This will cause `greeting` to be `undefined`, triggering the code to default it to \"Hello\", but `name` would be \"Hi\", which might not be the intended use.\n     - Fix this by passing the correct number of arguments or set defaults in the constructor: `constructor(name = \"Anonymous\", greeting = \"Hello\")`.\n\n5. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - The class `Greeter` could benefit from proper default parameters in the constructor.\n     - Using default values improves code readability and ensures that the object is instantiated with reasonable defaults if arguments are omitted.\n     - Update the constructor to: `constructor(name = \"Anonymous\", greeting = \"Hello\") { this.name = name; this.greeting = greeting; }`.\n\nTotal bugs: 3\nTotal quality issues: 2",
