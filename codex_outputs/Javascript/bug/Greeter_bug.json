  "response": "1. Incorrect equality check in 'if' statement:\nThe issue here is the use of a single equals sign '=' in the if statement 'if (greeting = undefined)'. This is an assignment, not a comparison, which will set 'greeting' to undefined rather than checking if it is undefined.\nTo fix this, use '===' for strict comparison: 'if (greeting === undefined)'.\n\n2. Incorrect handling of string interpolation:\nThe return statement uses single quotes, which treat the string literally, including the interpolation symbols. This will not substitute the variables. \nTo fix this, use backticks ` instead of single quotes: return `${greeting}, ${name}!`.\n\n3. Variables re-assignment error due to 'const':\nThe 'name' and 'greeting' variables are declared as 'const' but are attempted to be reassigned later in the method. 'const' variables cannot be reassigned. \nTo fix this, declare these variables using 'let' instead of 'const'.\n\n4. Missing parameter in constructor call:\nThe instance 'g' is created with 'new Greeter(\"Hi\")', but the constructor requires two parameters. Since 'greeting' is missing, it will become undefined. \nTo fix this, provide both parameters when creating the instance: new Greeter(\"Hi\", \"your_greeting_here\").\n\n5. Unused variable 'g':\nThe variable 'g' is declared but not used meaningfully. This is not critical unless you plan to use it, but it's generally better to avoid unused variables, although it's more of a coding style issue.\n\nTotal bugs: 3\nTotal quality issues: 2",
