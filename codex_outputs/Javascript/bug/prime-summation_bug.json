  "response": "1. Issue: Ineffective prime check logic\n   - Explanation: The `isPrime` function uses `arr.every` with `return number % e`, which improperly checks for primality. Non-zero numbers are truthy in JavaScript, so this condition is always true for any non-zero modulus result.\n   - Problem: Inefficient prime checking logic might lead to incorrect addition of numbers to `vecOfPrimes`.\n   - Fix: Correct the condition by using `return number % e !== 0`.\n\n2. Issue: Redundant `isSmallEnough` function\n   - Explanation: The `isSmallEnough` function is used for filtering numbers smaller than `n`, but could be simplified.\n   - Problem: Increases code complexity unnecessarily.\n   - Fix: Replace it with a simple inline arrow function: `var filtered = vecOfPrimes.filter(v => v < n);`.\n\n3. Issue: Excessive prime search loop\n   - Explanation: The loop runs until `vecOfPrimes.length < 10001` even though it should only generate primes until they exceed `n`.\n   - Problem: This is inefficient and computationally wasteful for inputs far smaller than the 10,001st prime.\n   - Fix: Adjust the loop condition to `while(vecOfPrimes[vecOfPrimes.length - 1] < n)`.\n\n4. Issue: Magic numbers (like 10001)\n   - Explanation: The use of literal numbers like 10001 is unclear without context or comments.\n   - Problem: The purpose and reasoning behind using these numbers are unclear.\n   - Fix: Assign meaningful variable names or add comments explaining their significance.\n\n5. Issue: Var keyword use\n   - Explanation: The code uses `var` instead of `let` or `const` for variables like `filtered`.\n   - Problem: Using `var` can lead to scope-related bugs due to function scoping. `let` and `const` are block-scoped and more suited for modern JavaScript.\n   - Fix: Replace `var filtered` with `let filtered`.\n\n6. Issue: Total calculation logic comments inconsistency\n   - Explanation: The comment suggests the goal is to get the 10,001st prime, which is unrelated to the function signature and tests.\n   - Problem: Misleading comments can lead to confusion about the function's purpose.\n   - Fix: Remove or correct misleading comments or create a more accurate explanation of how the logic aligns with expected outputs.\n\nTotal bugs: 1",
