  "response": "1. Category: BUG\n   - Explanation: The isPrime function is flawed. The `every` method's callback returns the remainder of the division (`number % e`), which is truthy for any non-zero result. However, a prime check should return `false` if any division produces zero (meaning `number` is divisible by `e`). Using `number % e !== 0` should fix it.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: This causes non-prime numbers to be incorrectly identified as prime.\n   - How to fix it: Change the callback in `arr.every` to return `number % e !== 0`.\n\n2. Category: BUG\n   - Explanation: The loop condition `vecOfPrimes.length < 10001` will always attempt to find up to the 10001st prime. The function's logic should be based on the input `n`, not a fixed number.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: The function should find all prime numbers below `n`, not up to a fixed count of primes.\n   - How to fix it: Change the loop to `for (let i = 3; i < n; i++)`.\n\n3. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation: Poor naming of `vecOfPrimes`.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: The prefix `vec` is not descriptive or commonly used, which can cause confusion. Naming should be intuitive and descriptive.\n   - How to fix it: Rename `vecOfPrimes` to `primes` or `primeNumbers`.\n\n4. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation: The use of a helper function `isSmallEnough` is somewhat redundant.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: The function simply checks if a number is less than `n`, which can be inlined where the filter is applied.\n   - How to fix it: Combine the logic directly inside the `filter` call: `vecOfPrimes.filter(value => value < n)`.\n\n5. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation: The comment above the loop is misleading due to incorrect logic described in the comment.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: It states recursion is used, but recursion is not employed here. This can confuse maintainers.\n   - How to fix it: Correct or remove the misleading comment about recursion.\n\nTotal bugs: 2\nTotal quality issues: 3",
