  "response": "1. Logic Bug: Index Modification During Iteration\nIssue: The function modifies the array while iterating over it using `splice()`. This can cause the next element to be skipped because the indices of the array shift after removing an element.\nProblem: This leads to incorrect results as not all elements are checked or removed properly from the array.\nFix: Iterate backward through the array, or adjust the index accordingly to ensure all elements are checked.\n\n2. Code Quality Issue: Unnecessary Variable\nIssue: Creation of `elemCheck` variable.\nProblem: The variable `elemCheck` is used only once and increases the complexity without providing additional clarity.\nFix: Integrate the `indexOf` check directly into the `if` statement for simplicity: `if (newArr[i].indexOf(elem) != -1)`.\n\n3. Code Quality Issue: Use of Non-strict Inequality\nIssue: Use of `!=` for comparison.\nProblem: It can lead to unintended truthy or falsy type coercion, which could introduce subtle bugs.\nFix: Use strict inequality `!==` to ensure accurate comparison: `if (newArr[i].indexOf(elem) !== -1)`.\n\n4. Code Quality Issue: Deep Nesting and Code Readability\nIssue: The code uses nested loops and checks, which can impact readability and maintainability.\nProblem: Deep nesting is harder to understand and maintain as the complexity of the logic increases.\nFix: The current implementation is actually not deeply nested but can be simplified using early returns or helper functions if more complexity is needed in the future.\n\n5. Code Quality Issue: Misleading Comment\nIssue: The comments `// Only change code below this line` and `// Only change code above this line` suggest that some code should not be altered, but this context doesn't apply to this scenario.\nProblem: Such comments can confuse other developers or readers unfamiliar with the context.\nFix: Remove or replace comments with more contextually relevant information, if necessary.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 4",
