  "response": "1. Category: BUG\n   - The issue is that modifying the array while iterating over it leads to skipping elements.\n   - This happens because the splice method changes the length of the array and shifts elements down, resulting in missing checks on subsequent elements after a removal.\n   - To fix it, iterate backward through the array, which will prevent issues with index shifting when elements are removed.\n\n2. Category: BUG\n   - The issue is that the function is returning unexpected results: it should remove all sub-arrays that contain the specified element.\n   - Using indexOf on multidimensional arrays does not account for deep equality checks necessary for removing sub-arrays containing the specified element.\n   - Use an alternative method to check for the element within sub-arrays, such as a loop or Array.prototype.some(), to ensure all sub-arrays containing the element are removed.\n\n3. Category: QUALITY\n   - The variable name `elemCheck` is not descriptive.\n   - Having descriptive variable names improves code readability and maintainability.\n   - Rename `elemCheck` to something more descriptive, such as `elementIndex`.\n\n4. Category: QUALITY\n   - There is unnecessary use of the spread operator to copy the array at the start of the function.\n   - While creating a new array isn't inherently bad, it could be better optimized by constructing `newArr` during the filtering loop.\n   - Use `filter` or build a new array directly, which would also simplify the code and improve performance by avoiding the copying step.\n\nTotal bugs: 2\nTotal quality issues: 2",
