The pricing logic can be improved to make it more precise or clear.\n- How to fix it: Implement a more precise calculation for the price based on specific logic or criteria (e.g., condition, mileage, etc.) or clarify how to interpret the range.\n\n2.  \n- What the issue is: `tuneCar` function sets the year to a string `'2011'`, whereas the year is expected to be a number.\n- Why it\u2019s a problem: Typing inconsistency may lead to unexpected results or errors when the year is assumed to be a number elsewhere in the code.\n- How to fix it: Change `this.year = '2011';` to `this.year = 2011;` to keep the year as a number.\n\nCategory: QUALITY  \n1.  \n- What the issue is: Use of `var` for the `Car` constructor function.\n- Why it\u2019s a problem: Using `var` is outdated and less predictable due to function-scoping and hoisting. Modern JavaScript prefers `let` or `const` for variable declarations.\n- How to fix it: Use `const` instead: `const Car = function(brand, model, year) {...}`.\n\n2.  \n- What the issue is: Lack of input validation or error handling for constructor parameters.\n- Why it\u2019s a problem: Without validation, incorrect inputs could lead to unexpected behavior or bugs.\n- How to fix it: Add basic validation checks within the constructor to ensure inputs are valid before assignment.\n\n3.  \n- What the issue is: The `getFullName` method uses `' ' + this.year` string to append to the car details.\n- Why it\u2019s a problem: Mixing strings and numbers without conversion may be error-prone and isn't clean.\n- How to fix it: Convert the number to a string explicitly or use template literals: ``return `${this.brand} ${this.model} Y: ${this.year}`;``\n\n4.  \n- What the issue is: The method name `tuneCar` is not descriptive of its function.\n- Why it\u2019s a problem: The name suggests modifying or improving the car\u2019s performance, not changing the year.\n- How to fix it: Rename the method to something more descriptive like `updateYear`.\n\n5.  \n- What the issue is: The `messageToDriver` property could be made private by using closures.\n- Why it\u2019s a problem: Exposing properties directly can lead to unintended modifications, reducing encapsulation.\n- How to fix it: Implement closures or use private class fields with modern JavaScript classes.\n\nTotal bugs: 2  \nTotal quality issues: 5",
