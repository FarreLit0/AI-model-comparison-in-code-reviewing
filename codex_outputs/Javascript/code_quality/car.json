  "response": "1. Issue: Hardcoded Magic Numbers in `calculatePrice` and `tuneCar`\n   Problem: Using hardcoded values like 1990, 2011, 1500, 30000 and the string '2011' make the code difficult to understand and maintain. It is not clear why these specific values are used.\n   Fix: Define constants with descriptive names to replace magic numbers. Example: `const OLD_CAR_YEAR_THRESHOLD = 1990;` and use these constants instead.\n\n2. Issue: Incorrect year update in `tuneCar`\n   Problem: Updating `this.year` to a string ('2011') may cause issues when performing year-based calculations.\n   Fix: Update `this.year` with a number (2011) instead of a string to ensure consistency and correctness in calculations.\n\n3. Issue: Potential Misleading Price Range in `calculatePrice`\n   Problem: The range '$1500 - 30000' returned for cars made between 1990 and 2011 might be more helpful if narrowed.\n   Fix: Consider implementing a more dynamic calculation or different price ranges to reflect the car's actual value more accurately within this year range.\n\n4. Issue: Poor Naming `messageToDriver`\n   Problem: `messageToDriver` is not a well-defined or standard property name for cars and is somewhat unclear.\n   Fix: Rename it to something more descriptive and relevant, such as `engineStatusMessage`.\n\n5. Issue: Inconsistent Property Access in `Car` Constructor\n   Problem: All car properties are directly modified except for the 'engineState' which uses a different style later in methods.\n   Fix: Maintain consistency by either using direct property access or encapsulating property state logic within methods.\n\n6. Issue: Overly Verbose Method `stopEngineWithCheck`\n   Problem: The method includes verbose messaging and inefficient checks by returning different strings based on engine state.\n   Fix: Simplify return statements by focusing more on relevant information like 'Engine has stopped' or introducing a logger.\n\nTotal bugs: 2\nTotal quality issues: 4",
