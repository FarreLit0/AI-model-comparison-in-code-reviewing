  "response": "1. Issue: Inefficient Asynchronous Handling\n   Explanation: The code uses `Promise.all` to initiate three random number generations concurrently but waits for them sequentially using `await` in earlier parts of the function.\n   Problem: This leads to a delay in execution as each `random()` call is awaited individually at first, negating the efficiency gained by `Promise.all` later. \n   Fix: Use `Promise.all` initially to obtain all random numbers in parallel and await them together.\n   ```\n   const [first, second, third] = await Promise.all([random(), random(), random()]);\n   ```\n\n2. Issue: Unused Promise Result\n   Explanation: The `if (await random())` is used to conditionally execute code, but no operations or consequences are defined inside its block.\n   Problem: The ambiguity of this line suggests unfinished logic or intent, and it can be misleading to others reading the code.\n   Fix: Either complete the logic that should execute when the condition is true or remove the block to avoid confusion.\n\n3. Issue: Magic Number\n   Explanation: The code contains a hardcoded magic number `3` (referring to the number of random numbers to generate).\n   Problem: Magic numbers can make code difficult to understand and maintain, as they lack context and reasoning.\n   Fix: Define a constant with a meaningful name to represent this number.\n   ```\n   const RANDOM_COUNT = 3;\n   ```\n\n4. Issue: Comment Style\n   Explanation: The comment `// do something` inside the `if` block is vague.\n   Problem: Non-descriptive comments do not provide clarity about the intended logic or purpose and can be misleading.\n   Fix: Provide a descriptive comment or remove it until logic is implemented.\n\n5. Issue: Inconsistent Syntax\n   Explanation: The function `sumRandomAsyncNums` incorrectly places brackets and spaces, such as without spaces before the opening brackets of async function.\n   Problem: Inconsistent syntax reduces readability and can cause confusion during code reviews.\n   Fix: Ensure consistent spacing and syntax style.\n   ```\n   const sumRandomAsyncNums = async () => { ... }\n   ```\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 4",
