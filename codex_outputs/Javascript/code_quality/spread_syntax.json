Currently, the code manually assigns each property from `stats` to `pikachu`.\n     - This is a problem because it leads to more maintenance work, especially if more properties need to be copied in the future.\n     - A cleaner approach is to use the `Object.assign()` method or the spread operator to merge the `stats` object into `pikachu`:\n       - Using `Object.assign`: `Object.assign(pikachu, stats);`\n       - Using spread operator: `const pikachu = { name: 'Pikachu \ud83d\udc39', ...stats };`\n\n2. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - The `pokemon` array is being populated with separate push statements for each new element.\n     - This is inefficient and leads to verbose code. Multiple items can be pushed in one go using a single `push` call or by initializing the array with all elements at once.\n     - Fix by replacing the multiple `push` calls with one: `pokemon.push('Bulbasaur', 'Metapod', 'Weedle');` \n     - Alternatively, you could initialize the array as: `let pokemon = ['Arbok', 'Raichu', 'Sandshrew', 'Bulbasaur', 'Metapod', 'Weedle'];`\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 2",
