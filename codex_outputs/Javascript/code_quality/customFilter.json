Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - The function `customFilter` replicates the functionality of the native `Array.prototype.filter` method.\n     - While using `reduce` to implement `filter` is an interesting exercise, it introduces unnecessary complexity and potential performance overhead compared to simply using `filter`.\n     - It's better to use `array.filter(predicate)` directly for improved readability and efficiency.\n\n2. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - The department \"Pizza Delivery\" for employee Arti may suggest that either the naming for departments lacks consistency or does not fit cohesively with the others.\n     - Inconsistent or unclear department names can lead to confusion and make the data harder to manage.\n     - Ensure department names are consistent and accurately reflect the business domain, such as normalizing department names or ensuring they match the organization's structure.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 2",
