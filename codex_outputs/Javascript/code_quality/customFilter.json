  "response": "1. Issue: Magic String for the Department\n   - What the issue is: The string \"IT\" in the predicate of the `customFilter` is hardcoded.\n   - Why it's a problem: Using magic strings can make the code less maintainable and harder to understand at a glance. If you want to filter a different department, you'll need to change this string manually each time.\n   - How to fix it: Define a constant at the top of the code, such as `const DEPARTMENT_IT = \"IT\";`, and use this constant in the predicate.\n\n2. Issue: Poor Naming for the `acc` Variable\n   - What the issue is: The accumulator variable in the `reduce` function is named `acc`.\n   - Why it's a problem: Although `acc` is a common abbreviation for accumulator, it may not be immediately clear to all readers what it represents.\n   - How to fix it: Rename `acc` to a more descriptive name like `filteredItems` or `result`.\n\n3. Issue: Redundant Functionality of `customFilter`\n   - What the issue is: The `customFilter` function essentially replicates the functionality of the built-in `filter` method for arrays.\n   - Why it's a problem: Implementing functionality that is already provided by built-in methods can lead to unnecessary code and potential errors. It may also reduce readability for those familiar with standard JavaScript methods.\n   - How to fix it: Use the built-in `filter` method on arrays instead of creating a custom function, like this: `let filtered = employees.filter(employee => employee.department === \"IT\");`.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 3",
