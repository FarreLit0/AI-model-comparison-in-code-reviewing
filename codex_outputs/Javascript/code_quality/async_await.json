  "response": "1. Issue: Uninitialized variables (first, second, third)\n   Explanation: The variables `first`, `second`, and `third` are declared but not initialized. Although they are assigned values before being used in arithmetic operations, it is usually good practice to initialize variables upon declaration to avoid any accidental misuse later in the code.\n   Fix: Initialize `first`, `second`, and `third` to 0 when they are declared.\n\n2. Issue: Magic numbers in the code\n   Explanation: Although not a severe issue in this context, the use of undefined values can appear as 'magic numbers'. This primarily refers to the way promises resolve new random numbers and sums them directly. It is often better to store such numbers or their generation mechanism in well-defined constants or utility functions for enhanced readability and maintainability.\n   Fix: Consider defining constants at the top or extracting repeated logic into utility functions when the logic becomes more complex.\n\n3. Code quality issue: Lack of error handling\n   Explanation: The current code does not handle errors that might occur during the asynchronous operations. Without error handling, the code may fail silently or with uninformative error messages, making debugging more difficult.\n   Fix: Append a `.catch()` block at the end of the promise chain to handle any possible rejections or errors that might occur during promise execution.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 3",
