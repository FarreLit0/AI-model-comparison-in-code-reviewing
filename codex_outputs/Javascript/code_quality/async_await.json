  "response": "1. Category: BUG\n   - The issue is that there is no error handling in the promise chain.\n   - This is a problem because if an error occurs during any of the promise resolutions, it will be unhandled, potentially causing unexpected behavior or application crashes.\n   - To fix it, add a `.catch` method at the end of the promise chain to handle any errors that may arise.\n\n2. Category: QUALITY\n   - The issue is the function `sumRandomAsyncNums` uses variables (`first`, `second`, `third`) that are declared outside their scope of use, and their initialization is delayed.\n   - This is a problem because it can lead to unclear code and is prone to errors if the code becomes more complex.\n   - To fix it, declare `first`, `second`, and `third` inside the relevant `.then` blocks where they are first assigned a value, thereby limiting their scope to where they are actually used.\n\n3. Category: QUALITY\n   - The issue is with the naming of the function `random`, which does not convey that it returns a promise.\n   - This is a problem because it can confuse developers as `random` usually implies a synchronous operation, while this function is asynchronous.\n   - To fix it, rename the function to something like `getRandomNumberAsync` to indicate its asynchronous nature.\n\n4. Category: QUALITY\n   - The issue is the use of `console.log` inside the promise chain of the `sumRandomAsyncNums` function instead of returning the final value for further processing.\n   - This is a problem because it limits the reusability and flexibility of the `sumRandomAsyncNums` function to just logging the result.\n   - To fix it, return the result rather than logging it directly within the function. Allow the caller to decide how to handle the result, such as logging or further processing.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 3",
