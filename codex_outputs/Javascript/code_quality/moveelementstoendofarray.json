  "response": "1. Issue: The function modifies a local variable `arr` and logs it, but the original array outside the function remains unchanged.\n   Explanation: The logic creates a new array and assigns it to the local variable `arr`, but it does not affect the original array passed as an argument. If the intention was to modify the original array in place, this approach fails.\n   Fix: If modifying the original array is desired, reassign elements of the same array. Use `arr.splice()` to rearrange elements within `arr` itself.\n\n2. Issue: The function name `moveElementsToEndOfArray` does not accurately describe what the function does.\n   Explanation: The function actually rotates the array to the left by `x` positions instead of specifically moving elements to the end. A misleading name can cause confusion.\n   Fix: Rename the function to something more descriptive like `rotateArrayLeft`.\n\n3. Issue: Unnecessary creation of new arrays `first_x_elements` and `remaining_elements`.\n   Explanation: Although syntactically correct, creating these intermediate arrays can be unnecessary if the array operation can be done in a simpler way or if memory use is a concern.\n   Fix: This issue can be kept as-is if code readability is improved by having the intermediate variables. Otherwise, you can combine the operations using spread syntax directly in one line.\n\n4. Issue: Magic Number `5` is used in variable `let k = 5;` in the test case.\n   Explanation: The use of specific numeric values directly in the code without explanation is termed as a 'magic number'. It makes the code less maintainable and understandable.\n   Fix: Define a constant with a descriptive name for the value, such as `const ROTATION_COUNT = 5;`.\n\n5. Issue: Incomplete edge-case handling.\n   Explanation: The algorithm does not account for edge cases where `x` is zero, negative, or where `arr` has only one element. These could potentially be valid inputs that should be handled.\n   Fix: Add conditionals to check for these cases and handle them accordingly, possibly returning the array unchanged for zero or invalid rotations.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 4",
