  "response": "1. BUG\n   - The issue is that the convergence check within the while loop is incorrect. It is comparing the difference between `x` and `approx`, rather than `approx * approx` and `x`.\n   - This is a problem because it does not correctly determine when the approximation is close enough to the true square root.\n   - To fix it, change the condition in the while loop to `while (Math.abs(approx * approx - x) > epsilon)`.\n\n2. CATEGORY: QUALITY\n   - The issue is the template comment at the top with instructions related to an editor template.\n   - This is a problem because it is unnecessary and does not contribute to the understanding or functionality of the code.\n   - To fix it, remove the block comment entirely.\n\n3. CATEGORY: QUALITY\n   - The issue is that the class and method names (`SQRT` and `sqrt`) do not follow Java naming conventions.\n   - This is a problem because it affects code readability and maintainability.\n   - To fix it, rename the class to `SqrtCalculator` or similar, using CamelCase, and keep the method name `sqrt` as it follows conventional naming in context.\n\n4. CATEGORY: QUALITY\n   - The issue is the lack of method-level comments explaining the purpose and the parameters of `sqrt`.\n   - This is a problem as it reduces the code's understandability, especially for other developers or for future maintenance.\n   - To fix it, add a comment block above the `sqrt` method explaining its functionality, what `x` and `epsilon` represent, and any constraints or expectations.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 3",
