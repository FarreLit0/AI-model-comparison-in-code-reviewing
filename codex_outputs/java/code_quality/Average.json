  "response": "1. Category: BUG\n   Explanation:\n   - What the issue is: The method returns 0 when the input array is empty.\n   - Why it's a problem: Returning 0 for an empty array could be misleading as it might suggest a valid average instead of indicating an empty input.\n   - How to fix it: Consider throwing an exception or returning a special value like `Double.NaN` to clearly indicate that the average cannot be computed for an empty input.\n\n2. Category: QUALITY\n   Explanation:\n   - What the issue is: The class name `JavaClean05_Average` is not following standard naming conventions.\n   - Why it's a problem: The name does not adhere to Java naming conventions which prefer descriptive and clear names without unnecessary prefixes or suffixes, making the code less readable and maintainable.\n   - How to fix it: Rename the class to something like `AverageCalculator` which is clearer and more descriptive.\n\n3. Category: QUALITY\n   Explanation:\n   - What the issue is: The code does not include any comments or documentation.\n   - Why it's a problem: Lack of comments can make the code harder to understand and maintain, especially for other developers who might work on it in the future.\n   - How to fix it: Add comments explaining the purpose of the method and its parameters.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 2",
