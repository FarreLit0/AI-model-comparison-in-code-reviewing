  "response": "1. BUG\n- Explanation: The function does not handle parentheses, which should be used to indicate priority and grouping of operations. Without handling parentheses, the function may return incorrect order of operations for expressions involving them.\n- Why it's a problem: Not handling parentheses will lead to incorrect parsing of mathematical expressions that include parentheses to dictate operation order.\n- How to fix it: Add handling for '(' to push onto the opstack and for ')' to pop from the opstack until '(' is encountered (discarding both parentheses).\n\n2. BUG\n- Explanation: The function does not handle operators correctly when one of the operators might not be in the precedence dictionary, which may cause a KeyError.\n- Why it's a problem: If the function encounters an operator not defined in the precedence dictionary, this will result in a runtime error.\n- How to fix it: Update the logic to manage unexpected tokens and ensure all operators are handled before accessing the precedence dictionary.\n\n3. QUALITY\n- Explanation: The function checks if a token is an integer using `isinstance(token, int)`, but this does not cater for floating-point numbers and other numeric types.\n- Why it's a problem: This narrow check limits the function's ability to correctly parse numerical tokens if floats or other numeric types are expected.\n- How to fix it: Consider extending the check to `isinstance(token, (int, float))` to cover more numeric scenarios.\n\n4. QUALITY\n- Explanation: There are no comments or documentation explaining how the function works or what the parameters and outputs are.\n- Why it's a problem: Lack of documentation makes the code less understandable and harder to maintain or extend.\n- How to fix it: Add comments or a docstring at the beginning of the function detailing its purpose, parameters, and return value.\n\n5. QUALITY\n- Explanation: Variable names like `rpntokens` and `opstack` are not self-explanatory, making it harder to understand their roles in the function.\n- Why it's a problem: Non-descriptive names reduce code readability and maintainability.\n- How to fix it: Update the variable names to more descriptive ones, such as `output_queue` for `rpntokens` and `operator_stack` for `opstack`.\n\nTotal bugs: 2\nTotal quality issues: 3",
