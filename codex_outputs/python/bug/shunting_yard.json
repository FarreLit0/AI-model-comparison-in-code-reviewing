  "response": "1. Issue: Missing condition to handle opening and closing parentheses.\n   Explanation: The shunting yard algorithm typically deals with mathematical expressions that might contain parentheses to enforce operation priorities. Without handling parentheses, the algorithm may not correctly process expressions that include them.\n   Fix: Implement handling of '(' by pushing it onto the stack and ')' by popping operators from the stack to the output until '(' is encountered.\n\n2. Issue: Handling of operators with same precedence isn't considered correctly.\n   Explanation: The shunting yard algorithm needs to differentiate between left and right associative operators. For common arithmetic operators like '+', '-', '*', '/', left-to-right associativity is correct, but this needs to be explicitly integrated into the logic.\n   Fix: Always pop operators with precedence >= the current token's precedence unless special handling for right associative operators is added.\n\n3. Issue: Token type checking may be oversimplified.\n   Explanation: The algorithm checks only if the token is an int, but a full implementation would need to check for operands (which could be floating point numbers) and possibly variable names as well.\n   Fix: Extend the logic to accommodate floats, variables, and potentially other operand types.\n\n4. Code Quality Issue: Poor naming of variable `tokens`.\n   Explanation: 'tokens' is a generic name that could refer to any list of tokens. In this context, a name indicating the origin (like 'expression_tokens') might be more informative.\n   Fix: Rename instance of 'tokens' to 'expression_tokens' or a similarly informative name.\n\n5. Code Quality Issue: Unused Precedence Key Handling.\n   Explanation: There is no error handling or notification if a token is unrecognized (i.e., not a valid integer or operator in the precedence map). This can cause the absence of relevant error messages.\n   Fix: Add a condition to handle unexpected tokens by raising an exception or returning an error message.\n\nTotal bugs: 2\nTotal quality issues: 3",
