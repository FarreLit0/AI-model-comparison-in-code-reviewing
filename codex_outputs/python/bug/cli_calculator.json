  "response": "1. Category: BUG\n   - Explanation:\n     - Division by zero is not handled.\n     - This will cause a runtime error if the user inputs zero as the second number and chooses division.\n     - Add a check to ensure that if the operation is division, the second number is not zero.\n\n2. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - The function `calculate()` does not return any value, which makes testing and reuse difficult.\n     - Returning the result of the calculation allows this function to be used programmatically rather than being limited to just console I/O.\n     - Modify the `calculate()` function to return the calculation result instead of or in addition to printing it.\n\n3. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - Magic strings are used directly in the code for operations ('+', '-', '*', '/').\n     - Magic strings can lead to errors and make the code less readable.\n     - Define constants for the operations to improve readability and maintainability.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 2",
