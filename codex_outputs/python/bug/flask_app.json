  "response": "1. Category: BUG\n   - Explanation: The login function assumes that the username exists in the users dictionary without checking. If a non-existent username is provided, it will raise a KeyError.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: This can lead to server errors when users attempt to log in with a username that isn't registered.\n   - How to fix it: Check if the username exists in the users dictionary before comparing the password.\n\n2. Category: BUG\n   - Explanation: Both the register and login functions are storing and verifying passwords in plain text.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: Storing plain text passwords is a significant security risk, as it exposes users' passwords to anyone with access to the data.\n   - How to fix it: Use a password hashing library, such as bcrypt, to securely hash and verify passwords.\n\n3. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation: The users dictionary is stored at the global level, which is not thread-safe.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: Flask's default server may handle requests in parallel, leading to race conditions when accessing or modifying shared data.\n   - How to fix it: Use a thread-safe data storage method, such as a database or an external service, to handle user data.\n\n4. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation: Using HTTP methods incorrectly; the register and login routes respond successfully with a 200 status code by default.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: This is technically correct but can be improved by explicitly defining the status code for clarity and maintainability.\n   - How to fix it: Return an explicit 201 status code for successful registration and 200 for successful login.\n\nTotal bugs: 2\nTotal quality issues: 2",
