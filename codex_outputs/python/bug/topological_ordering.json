  "response": "1. Logic issue: The current approach to adding nodes to `ordered_nodes` is incorrect for calculating a topological sort. It checks if all outgoing nodes of `nextnode` are already in `ordered_nodes` and adds `nextnode` if they are. This logic is flawed because it does not consider the prerequisite of processing incoming nodes first in a topological sort. A node should only be added when all of its incoming nodes have been added. To fix this, reverse the logic: iterate over nodes, adding those with no remaining incoming edges and updating counts of incoming edges for each node.\n\n2. Code quality issue: Deep nesting. The code uses nested loops with an if statement inside. Deep nesting can reduce readability and comprehension. To fix this, consider simplifying conditions or using helper functions to handle nested logic.\n\n3. Code quality issue: Poor naming. The variable `nextnode` should be named `next_node` to follow PEP 8 naming conventions, which recommends using underscores for variable names to improve readability.\n\n4. Code quality issue: Inefficient use of `set`. The code converts `ordered_nodes` into a set multiple times within the loop. This is inefficient, as creating a set from a list is costly and unnecessary for every iteration. To fix this, maintain a set of already added nodes and check membership in constant time.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 3",
