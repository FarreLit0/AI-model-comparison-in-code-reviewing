Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - What the issue is: The function name `calcArea` is vague and does not specify which area it is calculating (in this case, the area of a circle). \n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: Vague naming reduces code readability and makes it harder for other developers (or the original developer at a later time) to understand the purpose of the function quickly.\n     - How to fix it: Rename the function to something more descriptive, like `calculate_circle_area`.\n\n2. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - What the issue is: The function uses a \"magic number\" for \u03c0 (pi).\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: Magic numbers reduce code readability, and using an approximation for \u03c0 might lead to precision issues.\n     - How to fix it: Replace the hardcoded number with a constant from a standard library if available, like `math.pi`, to improve accuracy and clarity.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 2",
