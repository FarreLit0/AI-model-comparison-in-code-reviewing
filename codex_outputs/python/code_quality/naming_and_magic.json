  "response": "1. Issue: Poor Naming\n   - Explanation: The function name `calcArea` is not descriptive enough and does not clarify what type of area it calculates.\n   - Why it's a problem: It can reduce code readability and make maintenance more difficult as the code base grows or gets more contributors.\n   - How to fix it: Rename the function to `calculate_circle_area` to make its purpose clearer.\n\n2. Issue: Magic Number\n   - Explanation: The number `3.14159` is used directly in the calculation.\n   - Why it's a problem: Magic numbers reduce readability and can make the code difficult to maintain or understand. It is unclear why `3.14159` is used without additional context.\n   - How to fix it: Replace `3.14159` with a named constant, such as `PI = 3.14159`, and use `PI` in the calculation. Alternatively, you can use Python's `math.pi` for better accuracy and readability.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 2",
