  "response": "1. Issue: Improper use of set operations.\n   Explanation: The code uses the set operation to determine the auxiliary peg `helper` with `helper = ({1, 2, 3} - {start} - {end}).pop()`. While this works in this specific case because there are exactly three pegs, it may lead to confusion or errors if the sets have different numbers of elements or if there is a misunderstanding about the set operation.\n   Solution: Use a clearer approach to determine the helper peg. For instance: `helper = 6 - start - end` which utilizes the fact the sum of peg numbers is always 6 (1 + 2 + 3).\n\n2. Issue: Lack of documentation/comments.\n   Explanation: The function has no comments to explain its purpose, parameters, or the logic behind the recursive steps. This can make the code difficult to understand for someone else reading or maintaining it.\n   Solution: Add a docstring at the beginning of the function explaining its purpose, parameters, and algorithm. Add inline comments to clarify key parts of the code.\n\n3. Issue: Implicit use of numbers in set creation and subtraction (magic numbers).\n   Explanation: The numbers 1, 2, and 3 are used implicitly to denote the pegs. This can be unclear or cryptic to someone reading the code without knowing the context.\n   Solution: Use named constants for the pegs like START_PEG, AUX_PEG, and END_PEG to make the code more readable and maintainable.\n\n4. Issue: Inconsistent use of default parameter values.\n   Explanation: The function sets default arguments for `start` and `end` but assumes the user always provides the `height`. This could be more explicit and also include checking if `height` is a valid positive integer.\n   Solution: Ensure that the `height` parameter is checked to be a valid number before proceeding or include it in the function signature as a required parameter with a type hint.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 4",
