  "response": "1. Deep Nesting:\nThe logic is nested too deeply, making the code harder to read and maintain.\nTo improve readability, flatten the logic with logical operators or use an elif statement for better structure.\nRewrite the function:\n```\ndef check(x):\n    if 0 < x < 10 and x % 2 == 1:\n        print(\"Odd and within range\")\n```\n\n2. Function Name:\nThe function name `check` is vague and does not clearly convey its purpose.\nA descriptive name improves code readability and maintainability.\nRename the function to something like `check_odd_within_range` to better describe its functionality.\n\n3. Missing Return Statement:\nThe function does not explicitly return anything, which might lead to confusion in larger programs with expected return values.\nFunctions should return values or explicitly return `None` if applicable, depending on the program requirements.\nAdd `return None` at the end, or document the function to specify it doesn't return a value.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 3",
