  "response": "1. Mutable default argument:\nProblem: The function `store_data` has a mutable default argument `data=[]`. This can lead to unexpected behavior because default argument expressions are evaluated once when the function is defined, not each time the function is called. Therefore, if the `data` list is modified (e.g., by appending `val`), the changes will persist across subsequent calls to the function.\nSolution: Use an immutable default argument, such as `None`, and then create a new list inside the function if needed.\nFixed code: \ndef store_data(val, data=None):\n    if data is None:\n        data = []\n    data.append(val)\n    return data\n\n2. Unused variable:\nProblem: The variable `tmp` is assigned the value 42 but is never used in the function.\nWhy it's a problem: Unused variables add unnecessary clutter to the code, which can confuse those who maintain it.\nSolution: Remove the unused variable `tmp`.\nFixed code: Remove the line `tmp = 42`.\n\n3. Poor function naming:\nProblem: The function name `store_data` can be misleading as it suggests storing or persisting data, which is not actually happening (the function merely appends to a list and returns it).\nWhy it's a problem: Poor naming can cause confusion and make the code harder to read and maintain.\nSolution: Rename the function to something that accurately describes its behavior, such as `append_to_list`.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 2",
