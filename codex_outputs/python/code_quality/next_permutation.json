  "response": "1. Category: BUG\n   - Explanation:\n     - What the issue is: The function returns `None` if the input permutation is the last permutation in lexicographical order. \n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: Returning `None` can lead to unintended results and may not be the desired behavior for users expecting a cyclic permutation sequence.\n     - How to fix it: Instead of returning `None`, return the smallest permutation (i.e., sorted order) to continue cycling through permutations.\n\n2. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - What the issue is: The naming of `next_perm` is slightly misleading since it is a local variable and its name suggests a global or class-level significance.\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: Misleading names can confuse developers or users about the role and scope of the variable.\n     - How to fix it: Rename `next_perm` to `result_perm` or a similar term that does not suggest permanence beyond the function's scope.\n\n3. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - What the issue is: The code lacks inline comments or a docstring explaining the algorithm and its purpose, which can hinder understanding.\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: Without comments or documentation, future maintainers or users might find it challenging to understand the code's functionality.\n     - How to fix it: Add a docstring explaining the function's purpose, expected input and output, and a brief explanation of the algorithm.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 2",
