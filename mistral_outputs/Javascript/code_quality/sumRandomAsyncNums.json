  "response": "Total bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 4\n\n1. BUG - Incorrect usage of `await` in the conditional statement (if statement):\n   - Issue: Using `await` in the condition of an if statement is incorrect. It will always resolve to true because `await` returns a Promise, and a Promise resolves to either true (when resolved) or false (when rejected).\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: This leads to unexpected behavior because the condition will always be considered as true, and the code inside the if statement will always be executed.\n   - How to fix it: Remove the `await` keyword from the condition and use the `then` method or a `try-catch` block to handle the Promise's resolution.\n\n2. QUALITY - Missing variable declarations:\n   - Issue: There are variables (`first`, `second`, `third`, `r`) that are used but not declared before assignment.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: This can lead to confusion and errors, especially when working with larger codebases or when multiple developers are working on the same project.\n   - How to fix it: Declare the variables at the beginning of the function or use `const` to ensure that they are not re-assigned.\n\n3. QUALITY - Inconsistent naming conventions:\n   - Issue: The function `random` is named in camelCase, while the constant `randos` is named in PascalCase.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: Consistent naming conventions help improve readability and maintainability of the code.\n   - How to fix it: Choose a naming convention (camelCase or PascalCase) and stick to it throughout the codebase.\n\n4. QUALITY - Lack of comments and documentation:\n   - Issue: There are no comments or documentation in the code to explain what the functions do or how they work.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: Good documentation helps other developers understand the code and makes it easier to maintain and modify.\n   - How to fix it: Add comments and documentation to explain the purpose, inputs, and outputs of the functions.\n\n5. BUG - Redundant usage of `random` function:\n   - Issue: The `random` function is used to generate three random numbers for the sum, but another set of three random numbers is generated and logged without being used.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: This is a waste of resources, and it can be confusing for other developers who are reading the code.\n   - How to fix it: Either use the generated numbers for something useful or remove the redundant code.\n\n6. QUALITY - Code duplication:\n   - Issue: The same code (`await random()`) is repeated three times to generate the random numbers.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: Code duplication makes the code harder to maintain and increases the chances of errors.\n   - How to fix it: Use a loop or a function to generate the random numbers instead of repeating the code multiple times.\n\n7. QUALITY - Inconsistent spacing:\n   - Issue: There is inconsistent spacing in the code, such as the use of single spaces after keywords and before parentheses, but double spaces in other places.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: Consistent spacing helps improve readability and makes the code easier to follow.\n   - How to fix it: Choose a consistent spacing style and stick to it throughout the codebase.",
