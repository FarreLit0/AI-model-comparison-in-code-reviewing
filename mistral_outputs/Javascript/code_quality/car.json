  "response": "Total bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 3\n\n1. BUG - Incorrect calculation in the `calculatePrice` method.\n   - The method returns an incorrect price range for cars built between 1990 and 2011.\n   - Fix: Update the `calculatePrice` method to return a more accurate price range for cars built between 1990 and 2011.\n\n2. QUALITY - Naming issues in the `tuneCar` method.\n   - The method name is misleading as it sets the year to a specific value (2011) instead of tuning the car in a more general sense.\n   - Fix: Rename the method to something more appropriate, like `setYear` or `updateYear`.\n\n3. QUALITY - Redundancy in the `stopEngineWithCheck` method.\n   - The method performs the same engine stop action as the `stopEngine` method but with additional checks and side effects (setting the messageToDriver property).\n   - Fix: Remove the `stopEngineWithCheck` method and use the `stopEngine` method, adding checks and side effects within the method if necessary.\n\n4. QUALITY - Lack of consistency in variable naming.\n   - The `year` variable is both a constructor property and a method argument. This can lead to confusion and errors.\n   - Fix: Rename either the constructor property or the method argument to a different name to avoid confusion. For example, use `modelYear` for the constructor property and `year` for the method argument.",
