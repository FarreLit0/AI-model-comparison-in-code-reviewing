  "response": "Category: QUALITY\n1. Inconsistent naming conventions - The function name `moveElementsToEndOfArray` is not following a consistent naming convention. It would be better to name it `moveArrayElementsToEnd` or `shiftArrayElementsToEnd`.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: It makes the code less readable and harder to understand for other developers.\n   - How to fix it: Rename the function to a more descriptive and consistent name.\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n2. Lack of input validation - The function does not check if the `arr` or `x` parameters are arrays or numbers, respectively. This could lead to unexpected behavior.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: It can cause runtime errors or unexpected results.\n   - How to fix it: Add input validation checks to ensure that `arr` is an array and `x` is a number.\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n3. No error handling - The function does not handle any potential errors that may occur during the execution, such as when the `arr` is not an array or `x` is not a number.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: It can cause the function to fail silently, making debugging more difficult.\n   - How to fix it: Add error handling to handle potential errors gracefully.\n\nCategory: BUG\n4. Off-by-one error - The function assumes that `x` is a valid index for the array, but it does not account for the fact that array indices start at 0. This can cause the function to shift elements to the wrong positions.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: It can result in incorrect behavior of the function.\n   - How to fix it: Decrement the value of `x` by 1 before using it as an index.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 3",
