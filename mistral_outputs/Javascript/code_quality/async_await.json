If `Math.random()` returns an error, it will be propagated through the Promise chain but not handled.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem:\n     - Unhandled errors can lead to unexpected behavior and crashes in the application.\n   - How to fix it:\n     - Add error handling in the catch block of the Promise chain to handle any errors that may occur during the execution of the `random` function.\n\n2. BUG (Category: Functional Mistake)\n   - Explanation:\n     - The `sumRandomAsyncNums` function does not return a Promise. Although it is chaining Promises, the function itself does not have a return statement for the final Promise.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem:\n     - The function is not following the asynchronous pattern correctly, making it difficult to use in other parts of the application that expect a Promise.\n   - How to fix it:\n     - Return the final Promise from the `sumRandomAsyncNums` function.\n\n3. QUALITY (Category: Redundancy)\n   - Explanation:\n     - The `sumRandomAsyncNums` function stores the random numbers in separate variables (`first`, `second`, `third`) but does not use them anywhere else in the code.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem:\n     - Unused variables make the code harder to understand and maintain.\n   - How to fix it:\n     - Remove the unused variables if they are not needed for any other purpose.\n\n4. QUALITY (Category: Naming)\n   - Explanation:\n     - The variable names (`first`, `second`, `third`) do not provide any context about what they represent, making the code harder to understand.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem:\n     - Poor naming can make the code harder to read and maintain.\n   - How to fix it:\n     - Use more descriptive variable names that indicate their purpose. For example, `randomNumber1`, `randomNumber2`, and `randomNumber3`.\n\n5. QUALITY (Category: Maintainability)\n   - Explanation:\n     - The `sumRandomAsyncNums` function calculates the sum of three random numbers and logs the result, but it does not provide any way to customize the number of random numbers to sum or the logging behavior.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem:\n     - Lack of customizability makes the function less flexible and harder to reuse in different scenarios.\n   - How to fix it:\n     - Add parameters to the function to allow customization of the number of random numbers to sum and the logging behavior. For example:\n\n```javascript\nconst sumRandomAsyncNums = (numbersToSum = 3, shouldLogResult = true) => {\n    let numbers = [];\n\n    return Promise.all(Array(numbersToSum).fill().map(() => random()))\n        .then(values => {\n            numbers = values;\n            return numbers;\n        })\n        .then(values => {\n            let sum = values.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);\n            if (shouldLogResult) {\n                console.log(`Result ${sum}`);\n            }\n            return sum;\n        });\n}\n```\nIn this updated version of the function, the number of random numbers to sum can be customized using the `numbersToSum` parameter, and the logging behavior can be customized using the `shouldLogResult` parameter. The function also uses `Promise.all` to handle multiple Promises more efficiently.",
