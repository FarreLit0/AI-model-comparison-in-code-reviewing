Bug (Category: BUG)\n   - Explanation:\n     - The variable `ar` is declared with a missing closing quote, causing it to be a string instead of an array.\n     - Problem: This will cause issues when trying to access the array elements as it is not an array.\n     - Fix: Add a closing quote to the `ar` variable declaration.\n\n2. Quality Issue (Category: QUALITY)\n   - Explanation:\n     - The variable names `res1` and `res2` are not descriptive and do not convey the purpose of the variables.\n     - Problem: Poor naming can make the code harder to understand and maintain.\n     - Fix: Rename `res1` to `evenNumbers` and `res2` to `oddNumbers`.\n\n3. Quality Issue (Category: QUALITY)\n   - Explanation:\n     - The `segregateEvenOdd` function does not have any error handling or checks for empty arrays.\n     - Problem: This can lead to undefined behavior or unexpected results if the input array is empty.\n     - Fix: Add error handling or checks for empty arrays in the `segregateEvenOdd` function.",
