It would be better to name it `foodQuantity` or `foodAmount`.\n     - Fix: Rename `meal` to `foodQuantity` or `foodAmount`.\n\n2. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - The `diet` property is a string, but it could be an array of food items to represent a more diverse diet.\n     - Fix: Change the data type of `diet` to an array of strings (e.g., `['berries', 'leaves', 'insects']`).\n\n3. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - The `type` property is 'amphibious', but turtles are not amphibious creatures. They are reptiles.\n     - Fix: Change the value of `type` to 'reptile'.\n\n4. Category: BUG\n   - Explanation:\n     - The `feed` function returns a string that concatenates the animal's name, meal quantity, and diet. However, the quantity is hard-coded as 10 kilos, which may not be suitable for all animals.\n     - Fix: Make the meal quantity dynamic by accepting it as a parameter in the `feed` function.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 3",
