Issue: Incorrect assignment in the if condition for the `greeting` variable.\n   - What the issue is: The assignment operator (=) is used instead of comparison operator (== or ===). This will always assign the value of `undefined` to `greeting` instead of checking if it is `undefined`.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: This will cause the `greeting` variable to always have the value of `undefined` when it should default to \"Hello\" if not provided.\n   - How to fix it: Replace the assignment operator (=) with the comparison operator (== or ===) to check if `greeting` is `undefined`.\n\nCategory: QUALITY (2 issues)\n\n2. Issue: Unnecessary variable declarations inside the `greet` method.\n   - What the issue is: The variables `name` and `greeting` are declared inside the `greet` method, but their values are already accessible through `this.name` and `this.greeting`.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: This makes the code more complex and harder to understand, as it introduces unnecessary variables.\n   - How to fix it: Remove the unnecessary variable declarations and use `this.name` and `this.greeting` directly.\n\n3. Issue: Lack of template string syntax consistency.\n   - What the issue is: The template string syntax is inconsistently used. The string is not enclosed in backticks (`) in some places, but it is in others.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: This inconsistency can make the code harder to read and maintain.\n   - How to fix it: Use consistent template string syntax throughout the code.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 2",
