  "response": "There are both bugs and code quality issues in the provided JavaScript code. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **BUG** (Category: Bugs)\n   - Explanation:\n     - The `replace()` method in the loop is not used correctly. It should replace the old string with the new one, but it's actually modifying the original `arr[i]` in-place.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem:\n     - The `replace()` method is not effectively capitalizing the first letter of each word.\n   - How to fix it:\n     - Use `arr[i] = temp` to replace the old string with the new one.\n\n2. **BUG** (Category: Bugs)\n   - Explanation:\n     - The `toUpperCase()` method only changes the first character of the `temp` variable, but the rest of the string remains in lowercase.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem:\n     - The rest of the word remains in lowercase, so the entire word is not properly capitalized.\n   - How to fix it:\n     - Use `temp = temp.toUpperCase()` to capitalize the entire word.\n\n3. **QUALITY** (Category: Code Quality)\n   - Explanation:\n     - The function name `titleCase` suggests that it should convert a string to title case, but it only capitalizes the first letter of each word and leaves the rest lowercase.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem:\n     - The function name does not accurately reflect its behavior, which can lead to confusion.\n   - How to fix it:\n     - Rename the function to something more accurate, such as `firstLetterCapitalized`.\n\n4. **QUALITY** (Category: Code Quality)\n   - Explanation:\n     - The code uses a loop to capitalize the first letter of each word, but there's a built-in JavaScript method (`map()`) that could be used instead.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem:\n     - Using built-in methods can make the code more readable, efficient, and maintainable.\n   - How to fix it:\n     - Use `arr.map()` to apply the capitalization function to each word.\n\nTotal bugs: 2\nTotal quality issues: 2",
