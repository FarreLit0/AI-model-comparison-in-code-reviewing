  "response": "Total bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 2\n\n1. BUG\n   - Explanation:\n     - The code assumes `this.dateStarted` and `this.dateCompleted` are always defined and are Date objects. If they are not, the code will throw an error.\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential runtime errors.\n     - How to fix it: Check if `this.dateStarted` and `this.dateCompleted` are defined and are Date objects before using them in the code.\n\n2. QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - The variable name `rank` is not descriptive of its purpose. It would be better to name it something like `projectRank`.\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: Non-descriptive variable names make the code harder to understand and maintain.\n     - How to fix it: Rename `rank` to `projectRank`.\n\n3. QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - The `STATES` array is not defined in the provided code. It should be defined somewhere before this function is called.\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: Without the `STATES` array, the function will not work correctly.\n     - How to fix it: Define the `STATES` array before the `calculateOpenState` function.",
