  "response": "This Python code is a simple implementation of the Shunting Yard algorithm, which is used to convert infix notation to postfix notation. Here are the issues identified:\n\n1. **Category:** QUALITY\n   - Number: 1\n   - Explanation:\n     - Issue: The function name `shunting_yard` is not very descriptive. It would be better to name it something like `infix_to_postfix` or `shunting_yard_conversion`.\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: It makes the function less self-explanatory and harder to understand for others.\n     - How to fix it: Rename the function to a more descriptive name.\n\n2. **Category:** QUALITY\n   - Number: 2\n   - Explanation:\n     - Issue: The `precedence` dictionary uses operators as keys, which might lead to confusion when reading the code. It would be better to use a list of tuples instead, where the first element is the operator and the second element is the precedence value.\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: It makes the code less readable and harder to maintain.\n     - How to fix it: Change the `precedence` dictionary to a list of tuples.\n\n3. **Category:** BUG\n   - Number: 1\n   - Explanation:\n     - Issue: The code does not handle the case where the input contains multiple consecutive operators.\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: This can lead to incorrect results in the postfix notation.\n     - How to fix it: Modify the code to handle multiple consecutive operators correctly. One approach could be to check for consecutive operators and pop them all at once if they have the same precedence.\n\n4. **Category:** QUALITY\n   - Number: 3\n   - Explanation:\n     - Issue: The code does not handle negative numbers correctly. If a negative number is encountered, it will be treated as an operator.\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: This can lead to incorrect results in the postfix notation.\n     - How to fix it: Modify the code to handle negative numbers as numbers, not operators.\n\nAfter addressing these issues, the code could look something like this:\n\n```python\ndef infix_to_postfix(tokens):\n    precedence = [('+', 1), ('-', 1), ('*', 2), ('/', 2)]\n\n    rpntokens = []\n    opstack = []\n    for token in tokens:\n        if token.isdigit():\n            rpntokens.append(token)\n        elif token in ('+', '-', '*', '/'):\n            while opstack and opstack[-1][0] in ('+', '-') and opstack[-1][0] != token:\n                rpntokens.append(opstack.pop())\n            opstack.append(token)\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(f\"Invalid token '{token}' encountered.\")\n\n    while opstack:\n        rpntokens.append(opstack.pop())\n\n    return rpntokens\n```\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 3",
