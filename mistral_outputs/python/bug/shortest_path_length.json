Category: QUALITY\n   - Number: 1\n   - Explanation:\n     - Issue: Lack of documentation\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: Code without comments or documentation is hard to understand and maintain.\n     - How to fix it: Add comments and docstrings to functions explaining their purpose and parameters.\n\n2.
