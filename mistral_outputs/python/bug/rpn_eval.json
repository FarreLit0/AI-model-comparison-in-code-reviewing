This can occur if there are extra operators or if numbers are not properly separated.\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: It leads to incorrect results or runtime errors.\n     - How to fix it: Check if the stack is empty before popping from it at the end of the loop.\n\n2. Quality Issue (Category: QUALITY)\n   - Explanation:\n     - The `op` function is defined inside the main function, which makes it less reusable and harder to test.\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: It reduces the maintainability and testability of the code.\n     - How to fix it: Move the `op` function outside of the main function and make it a separate function that takes the operation symbol as an argument.\n\n3. Quality Issue (Category: QUALITY)\n   - Explanation:\n     - The variable names are not descriptive enough, making the code harder to understand.\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: It makes the code less readable and harder to maintain.\n     - How to fix it: Rename variables like `tokens` to `input_tokens`, `op` to `operation`, and `stack` to `operand_stack`.\n\nHere's the updated code:\n\n```python\ndef operation(symbol, a, b):\n    return {\n        '+': lambda a, b: a + b,\n        '-': lambda a, b: a - b,\n        '*': lambda a, b: a * b,\n        '/': lambda a, b: a / b\n    }[symbol](a, b)\n\ndef rpn_eval(input_tokens):\n    operand_stack = []\n\n    for token in input_tokens:\n        if isinstance(token, float):\n            operand_stack.append(token)\n        else:\n            a = operand_stack.pop()\n            b = operand_stack.pop()\n            operand_stack.append(operation(token, a, b))\n\n    if operand_stack:\n        raise ValueError(\"Stack is not empty at the end of the expression.\")\n    else:\n        return operand_stack.pop()\n```",
