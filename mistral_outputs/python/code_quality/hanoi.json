  "response": "Here are the issues found in the provided Python code:\n\n1. BUG\n   - Explanation: The helper variable is chosen randomly from the available poles, but it should always be the pole that is neither the start nor the end pole. This can lead to incorrect solutions when the start and end poles are close to each other.\n     - Fix: Change the helper variable selection to always choose the pole that is neither the start nor the end pole.\n\n2. BUG\n   - Explanation: The function does not handle the base case (height = 0) correctly. It should return an empty list instead of extending an empty list with an append operation.\n     - Fix: Change the base case to return an empty list instead of extending an empty list.\n\n3. QUALITY\n   - Explanation: The function does not document its purpose, inputs, or outputs. This makes it harder for others to understand and use the function.\n     - Fix: Add a docstring to the function that describes its purpose, inputs, and outputs.\n\n4. QUALITY\n   - Explanation: The function uses a mutable default argument (the 'steps' list). This can lead to unexpected behavior when the function is called multiple times with the same object.\n     - Fix: Change the 'steps' argument to a local variable or use the **kwargs syntax to accept an optional 'steps' argument.\n\n5. QUALITY\n   - Explanation: The function name 'hanoi' does not provide enough context about what the function does. A more descriptive name like 'tower_of_hanoi' would be more appropriate.\n     - Fix: Change the function name to a more descriptive name.\n\nTotal bugs: 2\nTotal quality issues: 3",
