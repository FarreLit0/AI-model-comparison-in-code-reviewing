  "response": "1. BUG\n   - Explanation:\n     - The function `doTask` is expected to perform some operation on two inputs `x` and `y`, but the second argument `y` has a default value of `100`. This means if only one argument is provided when calling the function, it will use `100` for `y`, which might not be the intended behavior in all cases.\n   - Fix:\n     - Make `y` an optional argument with a sensible default value that makes sense for the function's purpose.\n\n2. BUG\n   - Explanation:\n     - The local variable `unused` is declared but never used within the function. This is wasteful and may lead to confusion for future maintainers.\n   - Fix:\n     - Remove the unused variable.\n\n3. BUG\n   - Explanation:\n     - The function modifies the global `resultList` without explicitly declaring it as a global variable. This can lead to unexpected behavior and make the code harder to understand and maintain.\n   - Fix:\n     - Either make `resultList` a local variable and return it at the end of the function, or declare it as a global variable at the beginning of the function.\n\n4. QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - The function name `doTask` is not descriptive enough about what the function does. A more descriptive name would make the code easier to understand.\n   - Fix:\n     - Rename the function to something more descriptive, such as `calculate_sum_with_multiplication`.\n\n5. QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - The function does not follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). It calculates a sum and also seems to be intended for logging or debugging purposes. It would be better to separate these concerns into separate functions.\n   - Fix:\n     - Extract the logging or debugging functionality into a separate function if necessary.\n\nTotal bugs: 3\nTotal quality issues: 2",
