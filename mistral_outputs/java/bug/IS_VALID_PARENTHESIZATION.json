It should start with an uppercase letter and follow camel case.\n- Why it\u2019s a problem: It makes the code harder to read and understand for other developers who are familiar with the standard naming conventions.\n- How to fix it: Rename the class to \"IsValidParenthesization\" or any other appropriate name following camel case.\n\n2., QUALITY - Missing Javadoc\n- What the issue is: There is no Javadoc comment for the method `is_valid_parenthesization`.\n- Why it\u2019s a problem: Lack of documentation makes it harder for other developers to understand the purpose of the method, its input, and its output.\n- How to fix it: Add a Javadoc comment for the method, explaining its purpose, input, and output. For example:\n\n```\n/**\n * Checks if the given string of parentheses is valid.\n *\n * @param parens the string of parentheses to check\n * @return true if the parentheses are valid, false otherwise\n */\npublic static Boolean is_valid_parenthesization(String parens) {\n    // ...\n}\n```",
