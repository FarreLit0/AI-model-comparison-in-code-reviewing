Category: QUALITY\n   - Number: 1\n   - Explanation:\n     - What the issue is: The class name DEPTH_FIRST_SEARCH doesn't follow Java naming conventions for class names, which should be CamelCase.\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: Poor naming makes the code harder to read and understand.\n     - How to fix it: Rename the class to DepthFirstSearch.\n\n2. Category: QUALITY\n   - Number: 2\n   - Explanation:\n     - What the issue is: The inner class Search is not a good name since it doesn't clearly represent its purpose, which is to perform a depth-first search.\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: Poor naming makes the code harder to read and understand.\n     - How to fix it: Rename the inner class to DepthFirstSearchHelper or DfsHelper.\n\n3.
