  "response": "1. (BUG)\n   - Category: BUG\n   - Explanation:\n     - The function `levenshtein(String source, String target)` does not handle spaces or special characters correctly. For example, it considers a space as a single character, which might not be the desired behavior in some cases.\n   - Fix:\n     - Modify the function to treat spaces and special characters as individual characters. This can be done by replacing all spaces and special characters with their Unicode representations before comparing the strings.\n\n2. (QUALITY)\n   - Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - The comment at the top of the file suggests that the code was auto-generated. This is not a problem per se, but it could indicate that the code is not well-designed or tested, and that it may not meet the requirements.\n   - Fix:\n     - Review the code to ensure it meets the desired requirements and follows good programming practices. If necessary, refactor the code to make it more readable and maintainable.\n\n3. (QUALITY)\n   - Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - The naming of the class `LEVENSHTEIN` does not follow the Java naming conventions, which recommend using CamelCase for class names.\n   - Fix:\n     - Rename the class to `Levenshtein`.\n\n4. (QUALITY)\n   - Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - The Javadoc comment for the class is empty, which makes it difficult for other developers to understand the purpose and usage of the class.\n   - Fix:\n     - Add a Javadoc comment that explains the purpose of the class, its methods, and any important constraints or assumptions.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 3",
