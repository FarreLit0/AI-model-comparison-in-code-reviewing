  "response": "1. BUG\n   - Explanation:\n     - The Newton-Raphson method for finding the square root is used, but the initial approximation is too far from the actual value, leading to incorrect results for some inputs.\n     - Problem: The initial approximation is x/2, which may be too large or too small for large or small x, respectively.\n     - Fix: Use a better initial approximation, such as 1 for positive x or 0 for non-positive x.\n\n2. BUG\n   - Explanation:\n     - The code does not handle non-positive inputs correctly.\n     - Problem: If x is non-positive, the function will return NaN (Not a Number) because the square root of a non-positive number is not defined.\n     - Fix: Add a check for non-positive inputs and throw an exception or return an appropriate error message.\n\n3. QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - The code lacks documentation, making it harder for others to understand its purpose and usage.\n     - Problem: Lack of documentation makes the code less maintainable and more prone to errors.\n     - Fix: Add Javadoc comments to explain the purpose of the class and method, as well as any important assumptions or constraints.\n\n4. QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - The variable name \"epsilon\" is not descriptive enough.\n     - Problem: Poor naming makes the code harder to read and understand.\n     - Fix: Use a more descriptive name, such as \"precision\" or \"tolerance\".\n\n5. QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - The method does not follow the common Java naming conventions for method names, which are camelCase.\n     - Problem: Inconsistent naming can make the code harder to read and understand.\n     - Fix: Rename the method to \"computeSqrt\" or \"findSqrt\" in camelCase.\n\nTotal bugs: 2\nTotal quality issues: 3",
