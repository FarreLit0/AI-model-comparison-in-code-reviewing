  "response": "1. (QUALITY)\n   - Explanation:\n     - The method name `average` in the class `Average` is misleading. Since the class name is `Average`, it's expected that the method will return the average of double values, not just integers.\n   - Fix:\n     - Change the method signature to `public static double average(double[] numbers)`.\n\n2. (QUALITY)\n   - Explanation:\n     - The method does not handle the case when the input array contains non-integer values, which will throw a `java.lang.ClassCastException`.\n   - Fix:\n     - Add a check to ensure that all elements in the input array are integers before performing the calculation.\n\n3. (BUG)\n   - Explanation:\n     - The method does not handle the case when the input array is null. It will throw a `java.lang.NullPointerException`.\n   - Fix:\n     - Add a check to ensure that the input array is not null before performing the calculation.\n\n4. (QUALITY)\n   - Explanation:\n     - The method calculates the average by first converting the sum to a double and then dividing by the array length. However, the sum can be calculated as a double from the start, avoiding the need for an explicit cast.\n   - Fix:\n     - Change the line `return (double) sum / numbers.length;` to `return sum / numbers.length;`.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 4",
