  "response": "1. BUG\n   - Explanation:\n     - The constructor of the `Customer` class only accepts a `customerName` parameter and sets the `joiningDate` to the current date. However, there is no way to provide a custom `joiningDate`.\n     - Problem: This could lead to inconsistencies if the customer's actual joining date is not the current date.\n     - Fix: Add a parameter for `joiningDate` in the constructor or provide a method to set the `joiningDate` after object creation.\n\n2. QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - The class does not have a `toString()` method, making it difficult to easily print or display `Customer` objects in a user-friendly format.\n     - Problem: Lack of a `toString()` method can cause inconvenience when debugging or displaying objects.\n     - Fix: Implement a `toString()` method that returns a string representation of the `Customer` object.\n\n3. QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - The class does not follow the Java naming conventions for instance variables, which should be in lowerCamelCase (e.g., `customerName` should be `customerName`).\n     - Problem: Inconsistent naming can lead to confusion and make the code harder to read and understand.\n     - Fix: Rename the instance variables to follow Java naming conventions.\n\n4. QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - The class does not have any getters or setters for the instance variables, making it difficult to change the values of the properties after object creation.\n     - Problem: Lack of getters and setters can make the class less flexible and harder to work with in some scenarios.\n     - Fix: Add getters and setters for the instance variables.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 3",
