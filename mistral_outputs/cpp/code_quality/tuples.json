Category: QUALITY\n   - Number: 1\n   - Explanation:\n     - Issue: Using a custom pair structure (my_pair) in the code when std::pair or std::tuple could be used instead.\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: Custom pair structures are not standard and may lead to compatibility issues or unexpected behavior.\n     - How to fix it: Use std::pair or std::tuple instead.\n\n2. Category: QUALITY\n   - Number: 2\n   - Explanation:\n     - Issue: Using a custom function (reference_minmax) to find the minimum and maximum of two integers when std::minmax_element from the <algorithm> header could be used instead.\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: Custom functions are not reusable and may lead to duplicated code.\n     - How to fix it: Use std::minmax_element instead.\n\n3. Category: QUALITY\n   - Number: 3\n   - Explanation:\n     - Issue: Using a custom function (tuple_minmax) to return a tuple when std::tie could be used to unpack the tuple directly.\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: The custom function adds unnecessary complexity and may lead to duplicated code.\n     - How to fix it: Use std::tie to unpack the tuple directly.\n\n4. Category: QUALITY\n   - Number: 4\n   - Explanation:\n     - Issue: Using std::ignore in std::tie when it's not necessary.\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: std::ignore makes the code harder to read and understand, as it indicates that the value is being ignored without any reason.\n     - How to fix it: Remove std::ignore if it's not needed.\n\n5. Category: QUALITY\n   - Number: 5\n   - Explanation:\n     - Issue: Using the variable name \"t\" multiple times for different types (std::pair, std::tuple, and auto_pair).\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: This makes the code harder to read and understand, as it's unclear which type each \"t\" variable represents.\n     - How to fix it: Use more descriptive variable names to improve readability.",
