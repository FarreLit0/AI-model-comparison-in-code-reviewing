As a result, the thread `t3` does not have access to the variable `2` and will not print anything.\n     Why it\u2019s a problem: The code behaves incorrectly, and the user will not see the expected output.\n     How to fix it: Capture the variable by value (`[=]` or `[&]`) or by reference (`[&2]`).\n\n2. Category: BUG\n   - Explanation: The `parallel_sum` function does not handle the case when the length of the range is less than or equal to 1. This will lead to a segmentation fault or undefined behavior.\n     Why it\u2019s a problem: The code behaves incorrectly, and the program might crash.\n     How to fix it: Add a check for the length of the range and return the sum for small ranges directly.\n\n3. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation: The naming of the `t1`, `t2`, and `t3` variables is not descriptive enough. It is hard to understand what these threads do just by looking at their names.\n     Why it\u2019s a problem: The code becomes harder to read and understand.\n     How to fix it: Use more descriptive names for the variables, such as `threadFunction1`, `threadFunction2`, and `threadFunction3`.\n\n4. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation: The comment `//[thread Launch thread` is not useful and does not provide any meaningful information about the code that follows.\n     Why it\u2019s a problem: The code becomes harder to read and understand.\n     How to fix it: Remove the comment or make it more descriptive.\n\n5. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation: The comment `//[thread_param Launch thread with function parameter` is not useful and does not provide any meaningful information about the code that follows.\n     Why it\u2019s a problem: The code becomes harder to read and understand.\n     How to fix it: Remove the comment or make it more descriptive.\n\n6. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation: The comment `//[thread_lambda Launch lambda function` is not useful and does not provide any meaningful information about the code that follows.\n     Why it\u2019s a problem: The code becomes harder to read and understand.\n     How to fix it: Remove the comment or make it more descriptive.\n\n7. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation: The variable `workers` is used to store threads, but the name is not descriptive enough.\n     Why it\u2019s a problem: The code becomes harder to read and understand.\n     How to fix it: Use a more descriptive name for the variable, such as `threadPool` or `workerThreads`.\n\n8. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation: The comment `// - A vector can store reusable threads` does not provide any meaningful information about the code that follows.\n     Why it\u2019s a problem: The code becomes harder to read and understand.\n     How to fix it: Remove the comment or make it more descriptive.\n\n9. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation: The comment `// - The cost of creating threads might be higher than their work` does not provide any meaningful information about the code that follows.\n     Why it\u2019s a problem: The code becomes harder to read and understand.\n     How to fix it: Remove the comment or make it more descriptive.\n\n10. Category: QUALITY\n    - Explanation: The comment `// - Unfortunately, async does not necessarily go to a thread pool` does not provide any meaningful information about the code that follows.\n      Why it\u2019s a problem: The code becomes harder to read and understand.\n      How to fix it: Remove the comment or make it more descriptive.\n\n11. Category: QUALITY\n    - Explanation: The comment `// - It's best to use a library if you need async(...) a lot` does not provide any meaningful information about the code that follows.\n      Why it\u2019s a problem: The code becomes harder to read and understand.\n      How to fix it: Remove the comment or make it more descriptive.",
