BUG (Category: Logic)\n   - 1.\n     - Issue: The `process_input` function reads a line of input but does not validate it before converting to an integer. This can lead to incorrect values being assigned to `number`.\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: Incorrect values may cause unexpected behavior in the rest of the program.\n     - How to fix it: Implement input validation to ensure the user enters a valid integer before converting the input to an integer.\n\n2. QUALITY (Category: Naming)\n   - 2.\n     - Issue: The variable `number` in the `main` function has a non-descriptive name.\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: Non-descriptive variable names make the code harder to understand and maintain.\n     - How to fix it: Rename the variable to something more descriptive, such as `user_input`.\n\n3. QUALITY (Category: Redundancy)\n   - 3.\n     - Issue: The `using namespace std;` statement is used, which can lead to namespace pollution and make the code harder to read and maintain.\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: Namespace pollution can cause conflicts with other names in the program and make it harder to understand the code.\n     - How to fix it: Qualify the standard library functions with their namespace (e.g., `std::cout`, `std::string`, etc.) instead of using the `using namespace std;` statement.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 2",
