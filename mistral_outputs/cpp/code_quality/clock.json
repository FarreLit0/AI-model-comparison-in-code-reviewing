QUALITY (Poor naming) - The function `very_expensive_function()` might be misleading as it suggests that the function is computationally intensive but in reality, it only prints stars with a delay of 1 second each. Consider renaming it to `delayed_print_stars()` or similar to better reflect its purpose.\n\n2. QUALITY (Redundancy) - The code uses multiple ways to measure time: `clock_t`, `std::chrono::system_clock::now()`, `std::chrono::steady_clock::now()`. Stick to one for consistency. I recommend using `std::chrono::steady_clock::now()` as it is more portable and has better performance characteristics.\n\n3. QUALITY (Code duplication) - The code measures the time taken by the expensive function multiple times using different clocks (`clock_t`, `std::chrono::system_clock::now()`, `std::chrono::steady_clock::now()`). It would be cleaner to measure the time taken by the function once and print the result in different formats if needed.\n\n4. QUALITY (Unnecessary conversions) - There are multiple conversions between different time units (seconds, milliseconds, nanoseconds) which can lead to rounding errors. It is better to print the time in the original unit (seconds) and provide conversions for the user if needed.\n\n5. QUALITY (Code readability) - The code includes a commented-out section (`//[parsing \"Parsing\" time]`) that demonstrates parsing time from a duration. However, the rest of the code does not use this approach, and the commented section makes the code more cluttered. You can remove the commented section if it is not needed or move it to a separate part of the code if you plan to use it.\n\nHere's a refactored version of the code:\n\n```cpp\n#include <chrono>\n#include <iostream>\n#include <thread>\n\nvoid delayed_print_stars();\n\nint main() {\n    std::chrono::steady_clock::time_point start = std::chrono::steady_clock::now();\n    delayed_print_stars();\n    std::chrono::duration<double> elapsed_seconds = std::chrono::steady_clock::now() - start;\n    std::cout << \"Elapsed time: \" << elapsed_seconds.count() << \" seconds\" << '\\n';\n    return 0;\n}\n\nvoid delayed_print_stars() {\n    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {\n        std::cout << '*' << std::flush;\n        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));\n    }\n    std::cout << '\\n';\n}\n```\n\nThis version of the code measures the time taken by the `delayed_print_stars()` function using `std::chrono::steady_clock::now()`, prints the elapsed time in seconds, and uses a more descriptive name for the function.",
