  "response": "Total bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 4\n\n1. QUALITY (Lambda and auto_params)\n   - Issue: Using auto in the lambda function parameter can lead to confusion as it hides the type of the variable.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: It makes the code harder to read and understand, especially for developers not familiar with the codebase.\n   - How to fix it: Explicitly specify the type of the parameters.\n\n2. QUALITY (Lambda and capture)\n   - Issue: Capturing variables by value can lead to unintended behavior if the captured variable is modified outside the lambda.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: It can cause bugs that are hard to find and reproduce.\n   - How to fix it: Capture variables by reference (using [&]) or by copy (using [=]) depending on the intended behavior.\n\n3. QUALITY (Function object and redundancy)\n   - Issue: Using a function object (add class) for a simple addition operation.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: It adds unnecessary complexity and makes the code harder to understand.\n   - How to fix it: Use the built-in + operator instead.\n\n4. QUALITY (Binding and redundancy)\n   - Issue: Using std::bind for simple lambda functions.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: It adds unnecessary complexity and makes the code harder to understand.\n   - How to fix it: Use lambda functions instead.",
