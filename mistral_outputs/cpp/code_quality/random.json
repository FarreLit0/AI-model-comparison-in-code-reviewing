BUG (#1)\n   - What the issue is: The `mix_seed` function is used to mix the seed with other sources of entropy, but the mixing is not properly done. The XOR operation used to mix values might not provide a good distribution of values.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: The seed might not be sufficiently random, which can lead to predictable outcomes in the random number generation.\n   - How to fix it: Use a more suitable mixing function, such as the one described in the Knuth's \"The Art of Computer Programming\" (Volume 2, Section 3.2.1).\n\n2. QUALITY (#2)\n   - What the issue is: The `mix_seed_fn` function uses the FNV-1a hash function, which is not cryptographically secure. This function is intended for fast string hashing and not for mixing entropy sources.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: Using a non-cryptographically secure function for mixing entropy sources might not provide a good distribution of values, which can lead to predictable outcomes in the random number generation.\n   - How to fix it: Use a cryptographically secure function, such as the one described in the NIST SP 800-185.\n\n3. QUALITY (#3)\n   - What the issue is: The `mix_seed` function mixes an arbitrary fixed number (45). This number should not be hardcoded, as it can be a source of predictability.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: A hardcoded number can be a source of predictability, which can lead to predictable outcomes in the random number generation.\n   - How to fix it: Generate a random number instead of hardcoding it.\n\n4. QUALITY (#4)\n   - What the issue is: The `mix_seed` function mixes the address of an object allocated on the heap and the address of the pointer to that object. These addresses are likely to be the same, so they don't provide additional entropy.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: Mixing the same address multiple times does not provide additional entropy, which can lead to predictable outcomes in the random number generation.\n   - How to fix it: Use different addresses that are less likely to be the same. For example, you can allocate two objects on the heap and mix their addresses.\n\n5. QUALITY (#5)\n   - What the issue is: The `mix_seed` function mixes the address of the exit function and the address of the `_Exit` function. These addresses are likely to be the same across different platforms, so they don't provide additional entropy.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: Mixing the same address multiple times does not provide additional entropy, which can lead to predictable outcomes in the random number generation.\n   - How to fix it: Use different addresses that are less likely to be the same. For example, you can use the addresses of functions that are specific to the current platform.\n\n6. QUALITY (#6)\n   - What the issue is: The `mix_seed` function mixes the hash code of the `std::random_device` type. However, this hash code is not guaranteed to be unique across different implementations of the same type, so it might not provide additional entropy.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: Mixing the same hash code multiple times does not provide additional entropy, which can lead to predictable outcomes in the random number generation.\n   - How to fix it: Use a unique identifier for the current implementation, such as the build number or a version string.",
