  "response": "Total bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 3\n\n1. BUG - Dangling reference (deleting a pointer not owned by the reference)\n   - Issue: The pointer `p` is deleted, but the references `ppr` and `prr` are not updated to null. This means they are now dangling references, pointing to deallocated memory.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: Using dangling references can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.\n   - How to fix it: Instead of deleting the pointer `p`, set the references `ppr` and `prr` to null after the delete statement.\n\n2. QUALITY - Inconsistent use of references\n   - Issue: The code uses references for different purposes: stack references (`r1`, `r2`, `r3`), array alias (`ra`), and pointer alias (`ppr`). This can make the code harder to understand and maintain.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: Using references inconsistently can make the code less readable and more error-prone.\n   - How to fix it: Use references consistently for a specific purpose (e.g., use them only for stack variables, only for array aliases, or only for pointer aliases).\n\n3. QUALITY - Poor variable naming\n   - Issue: The variable names are not descriptive enough, making it hard to understand the purpose of each variable.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: Poor variable names can make the code harder to understand, maintain, and debug.\n   - How to fix it: Use more descriptive variable names, such as `stack_ref1`, `stack_ref2`, `stack_ref3`, `array_alias`, `pointer_alias`, `dangling_ref`, etc.\n\n4. BUG - Dangling reference (reference to deleted stack variable)\n   - Issue: After the stack variable `n` goes out of scope at the end of the function, the references `r1`, `r2`, and `r3` become dangling references, pointing to deallocated memory.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: Using dangling references can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.\n   - How to fix it: If you need to store the value of `n` after the function returns, consider returning it or storing it in a global or static variable. If the references are not needed after the function returns, set them to null before the function ends.",
