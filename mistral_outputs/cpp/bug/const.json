This can lead to silent code changes when the base class `B`'s `whoami` function is modified in the future.\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem:\n       - It violates the Liskov substitution principle, as objects of type `D` are not behaving as objects of type `B` should.\n       - It can lead to hard-to-find bugs and inconsistencies in the code.\n     - How to fix it:\n       - Add the `override` keyword to the `whoami` function in the `D` class.\n\n2. QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - The issue is the use of the `using namespace std;` directive at the top of the file. This can lead to name collisions and make the code harder to read and maintain.\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem:\n       - It can make the code harder to understand, as it becomes unclear which names are coming from the standard library and which are user-defined.\n       - It can lead to subtle bugs due to name collisions.\n     - How to fix it:\n       - Avoid using `using namespace std;` at the top of the file. Instead, use the `std::` prefix for standard library functions or qualify the names from the namespace with their full name.\n\n3. QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - The issue is the lack of descriptive and meaningful names for the classes `B` and `D`. This can make the code harder to understand and maintain.\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem:\n       - It makes it harder for other developers to understand the purpose and behavior of the classes.\n       - It can lead to confusion and errors when working with the code.\n     - How to fix it:\n       - Choose more descriptive names for the classes that clearly indicate their purpose and behavior. For example, `Animal` and `Dog` instead of `B` and `D`.",
