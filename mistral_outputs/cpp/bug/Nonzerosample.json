  "response": "Total bugs: 2\nTotal quality issues: 3\n\n1. BUG - Infinite loop (nxtNonZero function)\n   - The do-while loop will continue indefinitely because the initial value of `intnxt` is 0, and the condition `value == 0` will always be true.\n   - This can cause the program to hang or consume excessive resources.\n   - Fix: Initialize `intnxt` to a non-zero value, for example, 1.\n\n2. BUG - Unreachable code (nxtNonZero function)\n   - The return statement is placed after the while loop, which means it will never be executed.\n   - This results in undefined behavior since the function does not return a value.\n   - Fix: Move the return statement inside the while loop, just before the break.\n\n3. QUALITY - Static constant declaration (intnxt)\n   - Static constants should be defined at the file scope, not inside a class.\n   - This can cause confusion as it may appear that `intnxt` is a member variable.\n   - Fix: Declare `intnxt` as a file-scope constant.\n\n4. QUALITY - Naming convention (intnxt)\n   - The name `intnxt` is not descriptive and does not follow common naming conventions.\n   - Good variable names should be self-explanatory and easy to understand.\n   - Fix: Rename `intnxt` to something more descriptive, such as `nextNonZeroValue`.\n\n5. QUALITY - Memory management (main function)\n   - The memory allocated for `sample` is not being checked for any errors, and it's not being deleted after use.\n   - This can lead to memory leaks and potential program crashes.\n   - Fix: Use smart pointers or check for allocation errors, and ensure that memory is properly deallocated.\n\n6. QUALITY - Class design (NonZeroSample class)\n   - The purpose of the class is not clear from its name or implementation.\n   - A class should have a clear, well-defined purpose and follow the principles of encapsulation, abstraction, and inheritance.\n   - Fix: Rename the class to something more descriptive, such as `NonZeroNumberGenerator`, and consider refactoring the class to better follow object-oriented design principles.",
