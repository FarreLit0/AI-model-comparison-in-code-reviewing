  "response": "1. Bug (Category: BUG)\n   - Explanation:\n     - In the if statement checking for an invalid triangle, the comparison operator (<=) is incorrectly used as an assignment operator (=). This leads to incorrect behavior as the function will always return \"Invalid\" for any input.\n     - Fix: Replace the = operator with <=.\n\n2. Bug (Category: BUG)\n   - Explanation:\n     - In the if-else statements checking for the triangle type, the comparison operator (=) is incorrectly used for equality checks. This leads to incorrect behavior as the function will not correctly identify equilateral, isosceles, or scalene triangles.\n     - Fix: Replace the = operator with == or === (for strict comparison) for equality checks.\n\n3. Quality Issue (Category: QUALITY)\n   - Explanation:\n     - The function does not handle the case when the input parameters are not numbers. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.\n     - Fix: Add type checks or validation for the input parameters to ensure they are numbers.\n\n4. Quality Issue (Category: QUALITY)\n   - Explanation:\n     - The function does not return a meaningful message when the input parameters are invalid. A more descriptive error message would be helpful for debugging and understanding the issue.\n     - Fix: Update the return message for the invalid case to provide a more descriptive error message.\n\n5. Quality Issue (Category: QUALITY)\n   - Explanation:\n     - The function does not follow a consistent naming convention for the comparison checks. Using a consistent naming convention makes the code easier to read and understand.\n     - Fix: Rename the variables in the comparison checks to be more descriptive and consistent, such as $sideA, $sideB, and $sideC.\n\nTotal bugs: 2\nTotal quality issues: 3",
