  "response": "1. Category: BUG\n   - Explanation:\n     - The issue is the use of a single equals sign (`=`) instead of double equals (`==`) for comparison in the if statement. This leads to assignment rather than comparison, resulting in incorrect behavior.\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: The function will always return `true` for any age, not just 18.\n     - How to fix it: Replace the single equals sign with double equals (`==`).\n\n2. Category: BUG\n   - Explanation:\n     - The issue is that the function only checks if the age is exactly 18, but it should check if the age is greater than or equal to 18 to be considered an adult.\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: This means that people slightly older than 18 will not be considered adults.\n     - How to fix it: Change the comparison to `if ($age >= 18)`.\n\n3. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - The issue is the lack of proper function documentation.\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: Proper documentation helps other developers understand the purpose and usage of the function.\n     - How to fix it: Add a comment at the beginning of the function describing its purpose and input/output.\n\n4. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - The issue is the use of lowercase letters in function names, which is not following the PHP naming conventions (functions should start with an uppercase letter).\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: Following conventions makes the code easier to read and understand for other developers.\n     - How to fix it: Rename the function to `isAdult()`.\n\nTotal bugs: 2\nTotal quality issues: 2",
