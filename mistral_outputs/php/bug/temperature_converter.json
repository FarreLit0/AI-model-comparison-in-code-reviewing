Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - The function name `toFahrenheit` is descriptive, but it returns a string with the Fahrenheit value and the degree symbol, which can be confusing.\n     - It would be better to return the numeric value and let the caller handle the formatting if necessary.\n   - Fix: Change the return type to float and remove the degree symbol.\n\n2. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - The code does not follow the PSR-12 coding style guide, specifically the rule about spaces around operators.\n     - For example, there should be a space after the equal sign (=).\n   - Fix: Add spaces around operators to follow PSR-12.\n\n3. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - The function does not validate the input, so it can accept non-numeric values.\n     - This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.\n   - Fix: Add input validation to ensure that the `$celsius` variable is a numeric value.\n\n4. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - The function does not handle negative temperatures correctly, as the Fahrenheit scale does not have negative values below -459.67\u00b0F.\n     - It would be better to throw an exception or return an error message in such cases.\n   - Fix: Add a check for negative temperatures and handle them appropriately.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 4",
