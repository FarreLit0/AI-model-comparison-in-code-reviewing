It should be `==` instead of `=`.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: This will cause the function to always return true when the correct username and password are provided, which can lead to unauthorized access.\n   - How to fix it: Replace the comparison operator with `==`.\n\n2. Bug (Category: LOGIC)\n   - Explanation: The assignment operator is used instead of a comparison operator in the second `if` statement.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: This will always consider an empty username as true, which can lead to incorrect authentication results.\n   - How to fix it: Replace the assignment operator with `==`.\n\n3. Quality Issue (Category: NAMING)\n   - Explanation: The password is hardcoded and not secured.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: Hardcoding sensitive data like passwords can lead to security vulnerabilities.\n   - How to fix it: Store the password securely, for example, by using a hashing algorithm and storing the hashed value instead.\n\n4. Quality Issue (Category: READABILITY)\n   - Explanation: The code could be more readable by using consistent indentation and adding spaces after operators.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: Inconsistent indentation and lack of spacing can make the code harder to read and understand.\n   - How to fix it: Apply consistent indentation and add spaces after operators.\n\nTotal bugs: 2\nTotal quality issues: 2",
