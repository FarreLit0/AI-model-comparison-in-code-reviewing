  "response": "1. BUG\n   - Explanation:\n     - The issue is the use of equality comparison operators (==) instead of the identity comparison operators (===). This can lead to unexpected results if the variables are of different types but hold the same value.\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: It can cause security vulnerabilities if the user input is not properly sanitized, as it may allow an attacker to bypass the intended login process by providing a value of a different type (e.g., a string that is cast to an integer).\n     - How to fix it: Replace the == operators with === operators.\n\n2. BUG\n   - Explanation:\n     - The issue is the assignment within the if statement condition. This will always make the user and $validUser variables equal to the value of $validUser, and the pass and $validPass variables equal to the value of $validPass, regardless of the input.\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: This will always return \"Success\" regardless of the provided user and password, which is not the intended behavior.\n     - How to fix it: Remove the assignment within the if statement condition and use the comparison operators instead.\n\n3. QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - The issue is the use of single quotes for the $validUser and $validPass variables. This makes it easier for an attacker to inject malicious code by using single quotes in their input.\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: It can lead to security vulnerabilities if the user input is not properly sanitized.\n     - How to fix it: Use double quotes or escape the single quotes in the variables.\n\n4. QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - The issue is the naming of the function and variables. The function name should be more descriptive, and the variables should follow a consistent naming convention (e.g., camelCase or underscore_case).\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: Poor naming makes the code harder to read and understand, which can lead to bugs and maintenance issues.\n     - How to fix it: Rename the function to something more descriptive, such as checkAdminLogin(), and use a consistent naming convention for the variables.\n\nTotal bugs: 2\nTotal quality issues: 2",
