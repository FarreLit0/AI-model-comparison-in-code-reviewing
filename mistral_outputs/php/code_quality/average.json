A more descriptive name like `calculateAverageFromArray` would be more informative about the function's purpose.\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: It can lead to confusion when reading the code.\n     - How to fix it: Rename the function to a more descriptive name.\n\nHere's the updated code:\n\n```php\nfunction calculateAverageFromArray($numbers) {\n    if (empty($numbers)) return 0;\n    return array_sum($numbers) / count($numbers);\n}\n```",
