However, if the function is supposed to return a value, it needs to be updated accordingly.\n\n   - What the issue is: The function does not return any value when it should.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: The function's purpose is not fulfilled as it does not return a value when expected.\n   - How to fix it: Add a return statement for the function, either returning a value or using void.\n\n**Category:** QUALITY\n\n1. The function name `check($x)` is not descriptive enough. It would be better to use a more descriptive name that explains what the function does.\n\n   - What the issue is: The function name does not clearly describe its purpose.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: It makes the code harder to understand and maintain.\n   - How to fix it: Rename the function to something more descriptive, such as `isEvenNumberLessThan100`.\n\n2. The code inside the function checks for multiple conditions but does not handle the case when the number is greater than 100 or less than 0. It would be better to include these checks as well.\n\n   - What the issue is: The code does not handle numbers outside the range of 0 to 100.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: The function will produce unexpected results for numbers outside the specified range.\n   - How to fix it: Add conditions to handle numbers less than 0 and greater than 100.\n\n3. The function only prints \"Even\" if the number is even and within the range of 0 to 100. It would be better to return a boolean value indicating whether the number is even and within the specified range, or use an exception for out-of-range values.\n\n   - What the issue is: The function prints a specific message instead of returning a boolean value or throwing an exception.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: The function's output is not consistent with its purpose, making it harder to use in different contexts.\n   - How to fix it: Update the function to return a boolean value or throw an exception when the number is out of range.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 3",
