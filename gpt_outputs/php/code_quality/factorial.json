  "response": "1. Category: BUG\n   - Explanation:\n     - The function does not handle negative numbers appropriately. If a negative number is passed, the recursive call will continue indefinitely, leading to a stack overflow error.\n     - It's a problem because factorials are not defined for negative numbers, so this situation should be managed.\n     - To fix this, you should add a check at the beginning of the function to handle negative values by returning an error or a special value such as `null` or throw an exception.\n\n2. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - The function uses the identity comparison operator `===` when comparing `$n` to `0`, while `==` could be used for simpler type comparisons.\n     - It's a problem because although using `===` is not inherently wrong, it's unnecessary when comparing an integer to zero.\n     - To fix this, change `if ($n === 0)` to `if ($n == 0)`. However, note that using `===` is often more secure, so this is more of a subjective improvement.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 1",
