  "response": "1. BUG\n   - The issue is with the operand order in the operations.\n   - When popping elements from the stack, the first pop should be for the second operand and the second pop for the first operand as Reverse Polish Notation evaluates expressions by taking the second operand first.\n   - Swap the positions of `a` and `b` in the `op` function call like so: `op(token, b, a)`.\n\n2. BUG\n   - The issue is missing error handling for division by zero.\n   - Dividing by zero will cause a runtime error and unexpected behavior.\n   - Add a check before performing division to handle division by zero, possibly by raising an exception or returning an error message.\n\n3. QUALITY\n   - The issue is with the type check for tokens only accepting `float`.\n   - Restricting to `float` can be too limiting when dealing with whole numbers.\n   - Use `isinstance(token, (int, float))` instead to accommodate both integers and floats.\n\n4. QUALITY\n   - The issue is with no error handling for invalid tokens.\n   - Invalid or unrecognized tokens will lead to a `KeyError` or empty stack errors.\n   - Introduce error handling to manage unexpected tokens, such as raising an exception if the token is not a number or a supported operation.\n\n5. QUALITY\n   - The issue is with using dictionary access without checking key existence.\n   - Attempting to access a dictionary key without checking its existence can cause a `KeyError`.\n   - Utilize the `dict.get()` method with a default action to handle cases where the symbol might not be valid.\n\nTotal bugs: 2\nTotal quality issues: 3",
