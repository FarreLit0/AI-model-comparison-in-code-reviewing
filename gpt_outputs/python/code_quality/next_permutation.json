  "response": "1. Category: BUG\n   - Explanation: The function does not return a result if no next permutation is found (i.e., when the input permutation is the last permutation in lexicographical order).\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: The function will return `None` implicitly, which can lead to unexpected behavior when calling this function and not handling `None` type explicitly.\n   - How to fix it: Add a return statement at the end of the function to return the original permutation if no next permutation can be found, or raise an exception if that behavior is undesired.\n\n2. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation: The variable `next_perm` is redundantly created as a copy of `perm` when swapping elements.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: It introduces unnecessary copying, which can be avoided. This impacts performance, especially for large permutations.\n   - How to fix it: Modify `perm` directly to avoid creating a redundant copy. Since `perm` is not used elsewhere for computing, it can be safely modified in place.\n\n3. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation: Lack of documentation or comments in the code, explaining the purpose of each step and the entire function.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: It decreases code readability and maintainability, making it difficult for others (or the original author later on) to understand the code.\n   - How to fix it: Add comments that describe what each key part of the function is doing, especially the logic for finding the next lexicographical permutation.\n\n4. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation: The indices calculation can be clarified using meaningful variable names.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: Using inherently meaningful variable names makes the code more understandable and reduces cognitive load on someone reading the code.\n   - How to fix it: Instead of using single-letter variable names like `i` and `j`, use something more descriptive, such as `pivot` for the leftmost ascending digit and `successor` for the digit to swap with.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 3",
