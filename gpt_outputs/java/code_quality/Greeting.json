  "response": "Bugs: None\n\nCode quality issues:\n1. Category: QUALITY\n   - The class name JavaClean03_Greeting contains a numeric identifier \"03\", which is unconventional and may indicate an incomplete refactoring or a versioning practice that is better handled with version control systems.\n   - Using numbers in class names can lead to confusion and lack of clarity regarding the purpose or version of the class.\n   - To fix this, remove the \"03\" from the class name, renaming it to something more meaningful and descriptive, such as Greeting or GreetingGenerator.\n\n2. Category: QUALITY\n   - The method greet is static, which limits its flexibility and could make testing difficult if the greeting logic becomes more complex in the future.\n   - Using static methods can hinder object-oriented principles like inheritance and polymorphism.\n   - To improve this, consider making the greet method an instance method unless there's a specific reason for it to be static (e.g., it is part of a utility class).\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 2",
