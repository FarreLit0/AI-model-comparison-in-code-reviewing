  "response": "1. Category: BUG\n   - Explanation:\n     - The method `writerConfig()` is called in the `setValue` method, but it is not defined anywhere in the class. This causes a compilation error.\n     - Methods that are referenced but not defined will lead to a failure during compilation, preventing the code from running.\n     - Fix this by either defining the `writerConfig()` method or removing/renaming the call to a valid existing method or functionality.\n\n2. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - The class `JavaBad05_ExposeState` exposes its internal state directly through the `getConfig()` method, which returns the internal `HashMap` object. This allows external modification, potentially leading to unintended behavior and violates encapsulation.\n     - Exposing internal state can lead to security risks, data corruption, and difficulty in maintaining the code.\n     - To fix this, return an unmodifiable view of the `HashMap` or a deep copy instead, using methods like `Collections.unmodifiableMap(config)` or creating a new `HashMap` with the same entries.\n\n3. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - The class is named `JavaBad05_ExposeState`, which neither adheres to Java naming conventions nor conveys a clear purpose or responsibility.\n     - Class names in Java should use PascalCase and provide understanding of what the class represents or does.\n     - Rename the class to something meaningful, like `ConfigManager`, while following Java's naming conventions.\n\n4. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - The use of `HashMap` can be improved by using the interface `Map` as the type for the variable `config`. This promotes flexibility and allows changes to the specific implementation without affecting the rest of the code.\n     - Declaring variables and return types as their interface type instead of their implementation type enhances maintainability and fosters dependency inversion.\n     - Change `private HashMap<String, String> config = new HashMap<>();` to `private Map<String, String> config = new HashMap<>();`.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 3",
