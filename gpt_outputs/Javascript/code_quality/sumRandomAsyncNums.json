  "response": "1. Category: BUG\n   - Explanation: The conditional `if (await random())` is checking the truthiness of a random number. Since `Math.random()` returns a floating-point number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive), it will always be truthy and the conditional block will always execute.\n   - Why it's a problem: This can lead to unexpected behavior, as the conditional block is not controlled properly, diminishing the logic's intended purpose.\n   - How to fix it: Convert the random number to a boolean or compare it with a threshold, for example, `if ((await random()) > 0.5)` to have a meaningful condition.\n\n2. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation: The variable name `randos` is not descriptive.\n   - Why it's a problem: Non-descriptive or colloquial variable names reduce code readability and maintainability, making it harder for others (or yourself in the future) to understand the purpose of the code.\n   - How to fix it: Rename the variable to something more descriptive, such as `randomNumbers`.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 1",
