  "response": "1. Category: BUG\n   - The issue is that the variable `STATES` is used without being defined or passed as a parameter.\n   - It\u2019s a problem because it causes a reference error, which will result in the function failing to execute properly.\n   - To fix it, ensure that `STATES` is defined in the scope or passed as an argument to the function.\n\n2. Category: QUALITY\n   - The issue is the use of `var` for variable declarations.\n   - It\u2019s a problem because `var` has function scope and can lead to unintentional variable hoisting, which can cause bugs in larger and more complex codebases.\n   - To fix it, replace `var` with `let` or `const` depending on whether the variable will be reassigned.\n\n3. Category: QUALITY\n   - The issue is the redundancy in the conditional structure.\n   - It\u2019s a problem because the final `else` statement is unnecessary if the previous conditions are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, as these conditions already cover all possible cases.\n   - To fix it, remove the final `else` and directly assign `rank = 3`.\n\n4. Category: QUALITY\n   - The issue is the use of `else` after `if` and `else if` statements when each `if` condition already includes a return statement or complete coverage of conditions.\n   - It\u2019s a problem because it makes the code less readable and slightly more complex than necessary.\n   - To fix it, reconsider the logic to simplify conditions or document the logic clearly if truly needed.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 3",
