Category: BUG\n   - The issue is with the regular expression used in `split` method: `/\\W*\\d*[_]*/`.\n   - This pattern is incorrect for removing non-alphanumeric characters from the string, as it breaks the string at various points unnecessarily.\n   - To fix it, use `/[\\W_]/` in combination with `join('').toLowerCase()` to ensure that only non-alphanumeric characters and underscores are removed.\n\n2. Category: QUALITY\n   - The use of bitwise operator `>>` for flooring is unnecessary and unclear.\n   - Using `>> 0` for integer division serves as an implicit floor operation, but it's less readable.\n   - To improve code clarity, use `Math.floor(str.length / 2)`.\n\n3. Category: QUALITY\n   - The function logs intermediate steps to the console with `console.log`, which is unnecessary for the final version of the function.\n   - Printing debug information during execution can clutter the output and reduce performance.\n   - Remove or comment out the `console.log` statements used for debugging once the function is working correctly.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 2",
