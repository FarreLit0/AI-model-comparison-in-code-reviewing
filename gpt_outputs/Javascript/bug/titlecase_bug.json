  "response": "1. Category: BUG\n   - The issue is that the `toUpperCase` method is not modifying the first character of each word as intended.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: The method `toUpperCase` is called but not used correctly to change the first character to uppercase, leading to incorrect casing in the output.\n   - How to fix it: Replace `temp.toUpperCase(temp.charAt(0));` with `temp = temp.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + temp.slice(1);` to correctly capitalize the first letter of each word.\n\n2. Category: BUG\n   - The issue is that `arr[i].replace(arr[i], temp);` does not update `arr[i]` with the modified `temp`.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: The `replace` method does not modify `arr[i]`; it only returns a new string, which isn't stored or used.\n   - How to fix it: Directly assign `temp` back to `arr[i]` with `arr[i] = temp;`.\n\n3. Category: CODE QUALITY\n   - The issue is the use of the `replace` method in the line `arr[i].replace(arr[i], temp);`.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: It is redundant and misleading, as `replace` is not needed here.\n   - How to fix it: Remove this line and replace it with `arr[i] = temp;` as part of addressing the second bug.\n\n4. Category: CODE QUALITY\n   - The issue is unclear variable naming, such as `temp`.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: It does not convey meaningful information about its purpose, reducing code readability.\n   - How to fix it: Use a more descriptive name like `capitalizedWord`.\n\nTotal bugs: 2\nTotal quality issues: 2",
