  "response": "1. Category: BUG\n   Explanation:\n   - In the else branch, $result is being assigned a single value instead of appending it to the array.\n   - This overwrites the entire $result array with a single value, discarding any previously added elements.\n   - To fix it, change the else branch to $result[] = $val; or remove the else branch entirely.\n\n2. Category: QUALITY\n   Explanation:\n   - The function name filterArray is ambiguous and doesn't clearly convey what the function does.\n   - A more descriptive name like filterArrayGreaterThan or filterArrayByMinimum would be better.\n   - Rename the function to improve code readability and maintainability.\n\n3. Category: QUALITY\n   Explanation:\n   - The $limit parameter is not type-hinted, allowing any type to be passed.\n   - This can lead to unexpected behavior if a non-numeric value is passed.\n   - Add a type hint to specify the expected type, e.g., function filterArray($arr, int $limit).\n\n4. Category: QUALITY\n   Explanation:\n   - The if statement lacks curly braces for the single-line statements.\n   - While it works, it's prone to errors if additional lines are added without adding curly braces.\n   - Add curly braces to improve code clarity and avoid potential mistakes.\n\n5. Category: QUALITY\n   Explanation:\n   - The variable names $arr, $val, and $result are short and not very descriptive.\n   - Using more meaningful names like $inputArray, $value, and $filteredArray would enhance code readability.\n   - Rename the variables to provide better context and clarity.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 4",
