  "response": "BUG\n1. Explanation:\n   - The code echoes \"File opened\" when the file fails to open, which is incorrect.\n   - This gives the wrong impression that the file was successfully opened when it wasn't.\n   - To fix it, the message should be changed to indicate an error, like \"Failed to open file\", and it should be echoed when $handle is falsy.\n\nQUALITY\n1. Explanation:\n   - The function doesn't close the file handle after writing.\n   - This can lead to resource leaks and potential issues.\n   - To fix it, add fclose($handle) after the fwrite() call to properly close the file.\n\n2. Explanation:\n   - The function doesn't return any value to indicate the success or failure of the file write operation.\n   - This makes it difficult for the caller to determine if the write was successful.\n   - To fix it, the function should return a boolean value, such as true on success and false on failure.\n\n3. Explanation:\n   - The error message is directly echoed inside the function.\n   - This makes the function less flexible and harder to handle errors in different contexts.\n   - To fix it, the function should throw an exception or return an error value, allowing the caller to handle it appropriately.\n\n4. Explanation:\n   - The function doesn't handle the case when fwrite() fails.\n   - If fwrite() encounters an error, it will not be caught or handled.\n   - To fix it, add error checking for the fwrite() call and handle any potential failures.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 4",
