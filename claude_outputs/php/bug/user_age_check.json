  "response": "1. Category: BUG\n   Explanation:\n   - The condition in the if statement uses the assignment operator (=) instead of the comparison operator (==).\n   - This assigns the value 18 to the variable $age and always evaluates to true.\n   - To fix it, change the condition to use the comparison operator (==) or the strict equality operator (===).\n\n2. Category: QUALITY\n   Explanation:\n   - The if-else statement can be simplified by directly returning the result of the condition.\n   - Using an if-else statement for a simple boolean return is unnecessary and reduces code readability.\n   - To fix it, remove the if-else statement and directly return the result of the comparison.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 1",
