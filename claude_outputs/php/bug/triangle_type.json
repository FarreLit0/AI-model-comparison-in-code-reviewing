  "response": "Category: BUG\n1. Explanation:\n   - The condition checks for triangle inequality are incorrect. They should be strict inequalities (< instead of <=).\n   - This allows degenerate triangles to be considered valid.\n   - Change the conditions to: if ($a + $b < $c || $a + $c < $b || $b + $c < $a)\n\nCategory: BUG\n2. Explanation:\n   - The equality comparisons in the conditions for equilateral and isosceles triangles are using the assignment operator (=) instead of the equality operator (==).\n   - This assigns values instead of comparing them, leading to incorrect results.\n   - Change the conditions to use the equality operator (==) instead of the assignment operator (=).\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n3. Explanation:\n   - The variable names $a, $b, and $c are not descriptive and do not convey the meaning of the triangle sides.\n   - Using single-letter variable names can make the code harder to understand and maintain.\n   - Use more descriptive variable names like $side1, $side2, and $side3 to improve code readability.\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n4. Explanation:\n   - The if-elseif-else statements can be simplified by combining the conditions for equilateral and isosceles triangles.\n   - This reduces redundancy and improves code clarity.\n   - Combine the conditions as follows:\n     if ($a == $b && $b == $c)\n         return \"Equilateral\";\n     elseif ($a == $b || $b == $c || $a == $c)\n         return \"Isosceles\";\n\nTotal bugs: 2\nTotal quality issues: 2",
