  "response": "1. QUALITY - Inconsistent spacing: The code uses inconsistent spacing around the 'if' keyword and the return statements. It's best to follow a consistent style throughout the codebase for improved readability. Add a space after 'if' and before and after the comparison operator. Also, add spaces before and after the arithmetic operator.\n\n2. QUALITY - No input validation: The function does not validate the input parameter $n. It should check if $n is a non-negative integer to ensure proper behavior and avoid potential errors. Add a check to handle invalid input, such as throwing an exception or returning an appropriate error value.\n\n3. QUALITY - No type hinting: The function does not specify the expected type of the parameter $n. Adding type hinting can improve code clarity and catch potential type-related issues early. Use the int type hint for the $n parameter to indicate that it should be an integer.\n\n4. QUALITY - Recursive function without base case check: Although the function has a base case for $n === 0, it does not handle the case when $n is negative. This can lead to infinite recursion if a negative value is passed. Modify the base case to handle negative input by returning an appropriate value or throwing an exception.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 4",
