  "id": "add",
  "response": "1. QUALITY - Function name is too generic\n   - The function name \"add\" is very generic and doesn't provide any context about what it's adding.\n   - Generic names can make the code harder to understand and maintain, especially in larger codebases.\n   - Use a more descriptive name like \"addNumbers\" or \"sumIntegers\" to clearly convey the purpose of the function.\n\n2. QUALITY - Missing parameter type declarations\n   - The function parameters $a and $b don't have type declarations.\n   - Without type declarations, the function can accept any type of data, which may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.\n   - Add appropriate type declarations such as \"int\" or \"float\" to ensure the function only accepts the intended data types.\n\n3. QUALITY - Missing return type declaration\n   - The function doesn't have a return type declaration.\n   - Without a return type declaration, the function's return value type is not explicitly defined, which can make the code less readable and maintainable.\n   - Add a return type declaration such as \": int\" or \": float\" to clearly specify the type of value the function returns.\n\n4. QUALITY - Unnecessary closing PHP tag\n   - The closing PHP tag \"?>\" is unnecessary at the end of the file.\n   - Including the closing tag can sometimes lead to unwanted whitespace or newline characters being sent to the output.\n   - Remove the closing PHP tag to prevent any potential output-related issues and improve code consistency.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 4",
