To fix this, rename the function to \"isEven\".\n\n2. QUALITY - Unnecessary closing PHP tag: The closing PHP tag \"?>\" is unnecessary at the end of the file and can potentially cause issues with output buffering. It's best practice to omit the closing PHP tag in files that contain only PHP code. Remove the closing PHP tag to resolve this.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 2",
