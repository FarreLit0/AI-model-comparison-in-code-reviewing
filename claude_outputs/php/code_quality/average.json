It's not a technical issue but rather a matter of consistency with common PHP naming practices. Consider renaming the function to \"calculateAverage\".\n\n2. QUALITY - Unnecessary PHP closing tag: The PHP closing tag \"?>\" at the end of the script is unnecessary when the file contains only PHP code. It's considered a best practice to omit the closing tag to prevent accidental whitespace or newline characters after the tag, which can cause output buffering issues. Remove the closing \"?>\" tag.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 2",
