  "response": "1. QUALITY - Inconsistent braces placement: The opening braces for the if statements are placed on the same line, while the closing braces are on separate lines. It's best to follow a consistent style throughout the codebase for better readability and maintainability. Consider placing the opening braces on the same line as the if statements or on separate lines consistently.\n\n2. QUALITY - Lack of else statements: The function doesn't handle the cases when $x is less than or equal to 0, greater than or equal to 100, or when $x is an odd number. Adding appropriate else statements would make the function's behavior clearer and more comprehensive.\n\n3. QUALITY - Poor function naming: The function name \"check\" is vague and doesn't clearly convey what the function does. A more descriptive name like \"checkEvenNumber\" or \"isEvenInRange\" would be more appropriate.\n\n4. QUALITY - Missing function parameter type and return type: The function parameter $x doesn't have a specified type, and the function doesn't have a return type. Adding type hints for the parameter and specifying the return type would improve code clarity and catch potential type-related issues.\n\n5. QUALITY - Direct output instead of returning a value: The function directly outputs \"Even\" using echo instead of returning a value. It's generally better to separate the logic from the output and have the function return a value, allowing the calling code to decide how to handle the result.\n\n6. BUG - Incorrect logic for checking even numbers: The function only checks if $x is even when it is between 0 and 100 (exclusive). However, even numbers can exist outside this range. The check for even numbers should be independent of the range check.\n\n7. QUALITY - Unnecessary nesting of if statements: The if statements are nested unnecessarily. The conditions can be combined using logical operators to reduce the nesting and improve readability.\n\nFixed version:\n<?php\nfunction isEvenInRange(int $x): bool {\n    return $x > 0 && $x < 100 && $x % 2 === 0;\n}\n?>\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 6",
