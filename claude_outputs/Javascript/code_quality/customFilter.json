The 'employees' array could be declared using 'const' instead of 'let' since it is not being reassigned.\n   - Using 'const' for variables that don't get reassigned helps prevent accidental reassignments and improves code clarity.\n   - Change 'let employees' to 'const employees'.\n\n2. The 'filtered' variable could also be declared using 'const' instead of 'let' since it is not being reassigned.\n   - Using 'const' for variables that don't get reassigned helps prevent accidental reassignments and improves code clarity.\n   - Change 'let filtered' to 'const filtered'.\n\n3. The arrow function in the 'customFilter' call could be simplified to use implicit return.\n   - When an arrow function has a single expression as its body, the curly braces and 'return' keyword can be omitted for conciseness.\n   - Change 'employee => employee.department === \"IT\"' to 'employee => employee.department === \"IT\"'.\n\n4. The 'customFilter' function could be named more descriptively to indicate its purpose.\n   - A more descriptive name would improve code readability and make the function's intent clearer.\n   - Consider renaming 'customFilter' to something like 'filterArray' or 'applyFilterPredicate'.\n\nThere are no bugs identified in the provided code.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 4",
