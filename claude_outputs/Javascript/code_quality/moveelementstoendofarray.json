  "response": "1. QUALITY - The function name \"moveElementsToEndOfArray\" is misleading. It suggests that the elements are moved to the end of the array, but the function actually rotates the array.\n   - Explanation: The name does not accurately describe what the function does, which can lead to confusion and misuse.\n   - Fix: Rename the function to something more descriptive, such as \"rotateArray\" or \"shiftArrayElements\".\n\n2. BUG - The function modifies the input array \"arr\" but does not return the modified array. The modified array is only logged to the console.\n   - Explanation: The function should return the modified array so that the caller can use the updated array.\n   - Fix: Remove the console.log statement and add a return statement to return the modified array: \"return arr;\".\n\n3. QUALITY - The variable names \"x\" and \"n\" are not descriptive and do not convey their purpose clearly.\n   - Explanation: Single-letter variable names make the code harder to understand and maintain.\n   - Fix: Use more descriptive variable names, such as \"rotationCount\" instead of \"x\" and \"arrayLength\" instead of \"n\".\n\n4. QUALITY - The variable \"first_x_elements\" is not following the camelCase naming convention commonly used in JavaScript.\n   - Explanation: Inconsistent naming conventions can lead to confusion and reduced code readability.\n   - Fix: Rename the variable to \"firstXElements\" to follow the camelCase convention.\n\n5. QUALITY - The variable \"k\" is not used meaningfully in the code.\n   - Explanation: The variable \"k\" is assigned a value but never used, which can cause confusion and clutter in the code.\n   - Fix: Remove the variable \"k\" and directly pass the desired rotation count when calling the function: \"moveElementsToEndOfArray(arr, 5);\".\n\n6. QUALITY - The code lacks proper documentation and comments explaining the purpose and functionality of the function.\n   - Explanation: Without proper documentation, it can be difficult for other developers (or the original developer in the future) to understand and maintain the code.\n   - Fix: Add comments explaining what the function does, its parameters, and the expected return value. Consider using JSDoc-style comments for better documentation.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 5",
