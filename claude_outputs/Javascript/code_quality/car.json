  "response": "1. QUALITY - Inconsistent spacing and indentation makes the code harder to read. Fix by using consistent indentation (e.g., 2 or 4 spaces) and spacing around operators and after commas.\n\n2. BUG - In the calculatePrice method, the condition this.year > 2011 should be this.year >= 2011 to include cars from 2011. Fix by changing the condition to use >= instead of >.\n\n3. QUALITY - The calculatePrice method returns strings instead of numeric values, which can lead to issues if the result needs to be used in calculations. Fix by returning numeric values (e.g., 1500, 30000) instead of strings.\n\n4. QUALITY - The getFullName method includes 'Y: ' before the year, which is redundant since it's clear that the last part is the year. Remove 'Y: ' for better readability.\n\n5. QUALITY - The startEngine and stopEngine methods don't check the current engineState before changing it, which can lead to inconsistencies. Add a condition to check the current state before changing it.\n\n6. QUALITY - The tuneCar method changes the year property to a string '2011' instead of a number. Fix by assigning a number (e.g., 2011) instead of a string.\n\n7. QUALITY - The messageToDriver property is not used consistently across all methods. Consider removing it or using it in all relevant methods for better consistency.\n\n8. QUALITY - The stopEngineWithCheck method's success message ('all good. c u later') is too casual and unprofessional. Use a more appropriate message (e.g., 'Engine stopped successfully').\n\n9. QUALITY - The code lacks comments explaining the purpose of each method and the overall functionality of the Car class. Add comments to improve code readability and maintainability.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 8",
