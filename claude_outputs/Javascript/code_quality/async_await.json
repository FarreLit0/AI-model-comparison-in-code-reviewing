  "response": "1. QUALITY: The `random` function is unnecessarily wrapped in a Promise. Math.random() is synchronous and does not require a Promise.\n   - This adds unnecessary overhead and complexity.\n   - Remove the Promise wrapper and directly return the result of Math.random().\n\n2. QUALITY: The variable names `first`, `second`, and `third` are generic and do not provide meaningful context.\n   - Using descriptive variable names improves code readability and maintainability.\n   - Rename the variables to something more meaningful, such as `randomNum1`, `randomNum2`, and `randomNum3`.\n\n3. QUALITY: The `sumRandomAsyncNums` function does not handle potential errors.\n   - If an error occurs during the Promise chain, it will be silently ignored.\n   - Add a `.catch()` block at the end of the Promise chain to handle any errors that may occur.\n\n4. QUALITY: The result of the sum is only logged to the console, but the function does not return any value.\n   - This limits the usability of the function, as the caller cannot access the result.\n   - Instead of logging the result, return it from the function so that the caller can use it as needed.\n\n5. QUALITY: The `sumRandomAsyncNums` function does not provide any indication that it is an asynchronous operation.\n   - The function name does not clearly convey that it returns a Promise.\n   - Consider renaming the function to something like `sumRandomAsyncNumsAsync` or `sumRandomAsyncNumsPromise` to make it clear that it is asynchronous.\n\n6. QUALITY: The code lacks proper indentation and formatting.\n   - Inconsistent indentation and formatting can make the code harder to read and maintain.\n   - Apply consistent indentation and follow a standard formatting style to improve code readability.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 6",
