  "response": "1. QUALITY - Inconsistent naming convention: The function name \"sumRandomAsyncNums\" uses camelCase, while the variable \"randos\" uses a different convention. Stick to a consistent naming convention throughout the codebase, such as camelCase for both function and variable names.\n\n2. QUALITY - Unnecessary async/await usage: The async/await syntax is used unnecessarily in the if statement. Since the if condition is not dependent on the result of the random() function, using await is not needed. Remove the await keyword from the if condition.\n\n3. QUALITY - Unnecessary variable declarations: The variables \"first\", \"second\", and \"third\" are only used once and can be directly used in the console.log statement. Instead of declaring separate variables, you can directly use the await expressions in the console.log statement.\n\n4. QUALITY - Inconsistent formatting: The code has inconsistent indentation and spacing. Maintain consistent indentation and spacing throughout the code for better readability.\n\n5. QUALITY - Unnecessary async function: The \"sumRandomAsyncNums\" function is marked as async, but it doesn't return a promise or use the return keyword. If the function doesn't need to return a promise, remove the async keyword.\n\n6. BUG - Incorrect usage of for...of loop: The for...of loop is incorrectly used with the \"randos\" promise. The await keyword should be used before the Promise.all() call to wait for all the promises to resolve. Then, you can loop through the resolved values using a regular for...of loop.\n\nTo fix the bug:\n\n```javascript\nconst randos = await Promise.all([\n    random(),\n    random(),\n    random()\n]);\n\nfor(const r of randos) {\n    console.log(r);\n}\n```\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 5",
