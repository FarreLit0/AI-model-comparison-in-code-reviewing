Poor variable naming:\n   - The variables `foo`, `bar`, and `baz` have unclear names that don't convey their purpose.\n   - Using descriptive and meaningful variable names improves code readability and maintainability.\n   - Consider renaming these variables to reflect their actual content or purpose.\n\nQUALITY\n2. Unnecessary semicolon:\n   - There is an unnecessary semicolon after the `console.log` statement that logs \"My Friends\".\n   - While this doesn't cause any functional issues, it's considered good practice to omit unnecessary semicolons for cleaner code.\n   - Remove the semicolon after the `console.log` statement.\n\nBUG\n3. Undefined variables:\n   - The variables `foo`, `bar`, and `baz` are used without being declared or defined.\n   - This will result in a `ReferenceError` when the code is executed.\n   - Make sure to declare and assign values to these variables before using them.\n\nQUALITY\n4. Inefficient loop:\n   - The `while` loop is used to increment the variable `i` from 0 to 999999.\n   - This is an inefficient way to perform a large number of iterations and can potentially block the event loop.\n   - Consider using a more efficient loop construct like a `for` loop or optimizing the code to avoid unnecessary iterations.\n\nQUALITY\n5. Unnecessary function creation inside loops:\n   - The `deleteMe` function is defined using an arrow function inside the loop.\n   - Creating functions inside loops is generally inefficient and can lead to performance issues, especially with a large number of iterations.\n   - Move the function definition outside the loop to avoid recreating it unnecessarily.\n\nQUALITY\n6. Unclear purpose of `deleteMe` function:\n   - The `deleteMe` function logs a message \"bye bye database\" using `console.trace()`.\n   - However, the function name suggests that it deletes something, which is misleading.\n   - Consider renaming the function to better reflect its actual behavior or adding a comment to clarify its purpose.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 5",
