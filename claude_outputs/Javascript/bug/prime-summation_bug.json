  "response": "Bugs:\n1. The `isPrime` function is not correctly checking if a number is prime. The `every` method returns `true` if the callback function returns a truthy value for all elements, but the callback function `number % e` always returns a truthy value (the remainder of the division). This leads to incorrect prime number determination.\n\nQuality issues:\n1. The variable name `vecOfPrimes` is not descriptive and does not follow common naming conventions. A better name would be `primes` or `primeNumbers`.\n2. The `total` variable is initialized outside the `primeSummation` function, which is unnecessary. It should be initialized inside the function to avoid potential conflicts with other variables.\n3. The `isPrime` function is defined inside the `primeSummation` function, which is not necessary. It can be moved outside the function to improve code organization and reusability.\n4. The `result` variable in the `isPrime` function is not necessary. The `every` method can be directly used in the condition of the `if` statement.\n5. The `for` loop in the `primeSummation` function is unnecessarily iterating until `vecOfPrimes.length < 10001`. It should iterate until `i <= n` to generate primes up to the given number `n`.\n6. The `isSmallEnough` function is defined inside the `primeSummation` function, which is not necessary. It can be replaced with an inline arrow function in the `filter` method call.\n7. The `filtered` variable name is not descriptive. A better name would be `primesUpToN` or `filteredPrimes`.\n8. The `for` loop used to calculate the sum of primes can be replaced with a more concise and readable `reduce` method.\n\nTo fix the bugs and improve code quality:\n```javascript\nfunction isPrime(primes, number) {\n    return primes.every(prime => number % prime !== 0);\n}\n\nfunction primeSummation(n) {\n    const primes = [2];\n\n    for (let i = 3; i <= n; i += 2) {\n        if (isPrime(primes, i)) {\n            primes.push(i);\n        }\n    }\n\n    const primesUpToN = primes.filter(prime => prime < n);\n    const total = primesUpToN.reduce((sum, prime) => sum + prime, 0);\n\n    return total;\n}\n```\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 8",
