  "response": "1. QUALITY - Inconsistent indentation and spacing. Fix by using consistent indentation (e.g., 2 or 4 spaces) and spacing around operators and after commas.\n\n2. BUG - In the constructor, the second parameter is not being used correctly. It should be assigned to this.greeting. Fix by assigning the greeting parameter to this.greeting.\n\n3. QUALITY - Unnecessary variable declarations in the greet() method. The name and greeting variables are already accessible via this.name and this.greeting. Remove the const declarations.\n\n4. BUG - Incorrect comparison operator in the greeting check. It should be === instead of =. Fix by using === to compare greeting with undefined.\n\n5. BUG - Incorrect string interpolation syntax in the return statement. It should use backticks (`) instead of double quotes (\"). Fix by replacing the double quotes with backticks.\n\n6. QUALITY - Missing semicolon at the end of the Greeter instantiation line. Add a semicolon after new Greeter(\"Hi\").\n\n7. BUG - Missing argument for the greeting parameter in the Greeter instantiation. Provide a value for the greeting parameter or modify the constructor to handle a missing greeting.\n\nTotal bugs: 4\nTotal quality issues: 3",
