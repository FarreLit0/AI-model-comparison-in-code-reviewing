  "response": "1. QUALITY - Inconsistent variable naming\n   - The variable names use different naming conventions (camelCase and snake_case).\n   - Inconsistent naming makes the code harder to read and maintain.\n   - Use a consistent naming convention throughout the codebase, preferably camelCase for JavaScript.\n\n2. QUALITY - Unnecessary variable assignment\n   - The `lang` variable is assigned the result of a complex expression that could be simplified.\n   - Unnecessary variable assignments can reduce code clarity and performance.\n   - Simplify the expression and assign it directly to the `lang` variable.\n\n3. QUALITY - Inefficient string concatenation\n   - The `translation` variable is constructed using string concatenation with `+` operator.\n   - String concatenation can be inefficient, especially when dealing with complex paths.\n   - Use `path.join()` consistently to concatenate file paths.\n\n4. QUALITY - Unnecessary function wrapper\n   - The code inside `fs.stat()` callback is wrapped in an unnecessary function.\n   - The function wrapper adds unnecessary indentation and reduces code readability.\n   - Remove the function wrapper and directly execute the code inside the callback.\n\n5. QUALITY - Inconsistent error handling\n   - The error handling in the `fs.stat()` callback only logs a message and returns.\n   - Inconsistent error handling can lead to unexpected behavior and make debugging harder.\n   - Handle the error consistently, either by throwing an error or using a proper error handling mechanism.\n\n6. QUALITY - Unnecessary object creation\n   - The `message` array is created and populated with strings inside the `obj()` callback.\n   - Creating an array and pushing elements can be less efficient than directly concatenating strings.\n   - Concatenate the strings directly or use template literals for better readability.\n\n7. QUALITY - Lack of error handling for file read stream\n   - The code does not handle errors that may occur while reading the translation file.\n   - Lack of error handling can lead to unexpected behavior and make debugging harder.\n   - Add error handling for the file read stream to gracefully handle any potential errors.\n\n8. QUALITY - Unclear purpose of `this.push()` calls\n   - The code uses `this.push()` to push data to the stream, but the purpose is not immediately clear.\n   - Unclear code can make it harder to understand and maintain.\n   - Add comments or use meaningful variable names to clarify the purpose of `this.push()` calls.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 8",
