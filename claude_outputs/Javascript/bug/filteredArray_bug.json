  "response": "QUALITY ISSUES:\n1. Unnecessary spread operator when creating newArr. You can directly assign arr to newArr since you're creating a new array anyway.\n   - This adds unnecessary complexity and may impact performance for large arrays.\n   - Fix: let newArr = arr;\n\n2. Poor variable name \"elemCheck\". It doesn't clearly convey what the variable represents.\n   - This can make the code harder to understand and maintain.\n   - Fix: Rename to something more descriptive like \"index\" or \"foundIndex\".\n\n3. Unnecessary comparison with -1. The indexOf method already returns -1 if the element is not found.\n   - This adds unnecessary complexity to the condition.\n   - Fix: if (elemCheck !== -1) can be simplified to if (elemCheck).\n\n4. Inefficient removal of elements from the array using splice inside the loop.\n   - Splicing elements inside a loop can be inefficient and may cause unexpected behavior as the array indices change.\n   - Fix: Use the filter method to create a new array with the desired elements removed.\n\nBUGS:\n1. Incorrect output for the last test case.\n   - The expected output for filteredArray([[3, 2, 3], [1, 6, 3], [3, 13, 26], [19, 3, 9]], 3) should be [[1, 6, 3], [3, 13, 26]], but the current implementation returns [[1, 6, 3], [3, 13, 26], [19, 3, 9]].\n   - This is because the loop skips an element after splicing, causing some elements to be missed.\n   - Fix: Decrement the index (i--) after splicing to ensure all elements are properly checked.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 4",
