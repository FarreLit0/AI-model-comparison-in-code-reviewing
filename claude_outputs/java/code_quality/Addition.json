It doesn't clearly convey the purpose of the class.\n   - A more descriptive name like \"MathOperations\" or \"ArithmeticCalculator\" would be better.\n   - Renaming the class to a more meaningful name improves code readability and maintainability.\n\n2. The method name \"add\" is also generic and doesn't follow the Java naming convention for methods.\n   - Method names should start with a lowercase letter and use camelCase.\n   - A more appropriate name could be \"addNumbers\" or \"sum\".\n   - Following naming conventions improves code consistency and readability.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 2",
