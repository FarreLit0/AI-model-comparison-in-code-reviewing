  "id": "Nesting",
  "response": "1. QUALITY - Excessive nesting: The multiple levels of nested if statements make the code harder to read and understand. This can be improved by combining the conditions into a single if statement or using early returns.\n\n2. QUALITY - Missing else case: The code only handles the case when x is positive, even, and less than 100. It doesn't print anything for odd numbers or numbers outside the range. Adding an else block or separate conditions can make the behavior clearer.\n\n3. QUALITY - Unclear method name: The method name \"check\" doesn't convey what the method actually does. Renaming it to something like \"printEvenNumber\" or \"checkEvenNumber\" would improve code readability.\n\n4. QUALITY - Inconsistent formatting: The indentation of the if statements is inconsistent. Using consistent indentation helps improve code readability.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 4",
