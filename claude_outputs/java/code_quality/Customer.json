  "response": "1. QUALITY - The class does not follow the Java naming convention for packages. Package names should be all lowercase. Fix: Change the package name to \"com.baeldung.application.entity\".\n\n2. QUALITY - The 'joiningDate' field is not declared as final, even though it is initialized in the constructor and never modified. This can be misleading. Fix: Declare 'joiningDate' as final.\n\n3. QUALITY - The constructor does not validate the 'customerName' parameter. It's a good practice to validate input parameters to ensure data integrity. Fix: Add a null check and/or empty string check for 'customerName' in the constructor.\n\n4. QUALITY - The class is missing a toString() method, which is useful for debugging and logging purposes. Fix: Implement a toString() method that returns a string representation of the Customer object.\n\n5. QUALITY - The class does not override the equals() and hashCode() methods. If you plan to use Customer objects in collections or compare them for equality, it's important to provide proper implementations of these methods. Fix: Override equals() and hashCode() methods based on the unique attributes of the Customer class.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 5",
