  "id": "SQRT",
  "response": "1. QUALITY - Naming: The class name \"SQRT\" is not following Java naming conventions. Class names should be in PascalCase. Rename it to \"Sqrt\" or something more descriptive like \"SquareRootCalculator\".\n\n2. QUALITY - Naming: The package name \"java_programs\" is not following Java naming conventions. Package names should be in lowercase. Rename it to \"javaprograms\" or something more descriptive like \"math.sqrt\".\n\n3. QUALITY - Comments: The auto-generated comments at the beginning of the class are unnecessary and should be removed.\n\n4. QUALITY - Naming: The parameter name \"x\" is not descriptive. Rename it to something more meaningful, such as \"number\" or \"value\".\n\n5. QUALITY - Magic Number: The literal value \"2d\" is used as a magic number. Consider declaring it as a constant with a descriptive name, such as \"INITIAL_APPROXIMATION_DIVISOR\".\n\n6. QUALITY - Magic Number: The literal value \"0.5d\" is used as a magic number. Consider declaring it as a constant with a meaningful name, such as \"APPROXIMATION_ADJUSTMENT_FACTOR\".\n\n7. QUALITY - Redundant Qualifier: The \"d\" suffix used in \"2d\" and \"0.5d\" is redundant since the method is already declared to return a \"double\". Remove the \"d\" suffix.\n\n8. QUALITY - Braces: The \"while\" loop is missing braces. Although it works without them in this case, it's a good practice to always use braces for clarity and to prevent potential bugs if more statements are added later.\n\n9. BUG - Potential Division by Zero: If the initial value of \"x\" is zero, the code will encounter a division by zero exception when calculating the initial approximation. Add a check to handle this case, such as returning zero if \"x\" is zero.\n\n10. QUALITY - Method Signature: The method takes an \"epsilon\" parameter, but its purpose is not clear from the name. Rename it to something more descriptive, such as \"tolerance\" or \"precision\".\n\n11. QUALITY - Javadoc: The method is missing Javadoc comments describing its purpose, parameters, and return value. Add appropriate Javadoc comments to improve code documentation.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 10",
