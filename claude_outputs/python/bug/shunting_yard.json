Parentheses are typically used to control the order of operations in mathematical expressions and should be included in the precedence rules.\n   - Add parentheses to the `precedence` dictionary with the highest precedence value.\n\n2. The `shunting_yard` function doesn't handle the case when the `token` is an opening parenthesis `(`. According to the Shunting Yard algorithm, opening parentheses should be pushed onto the `opstack` when encountered.\n   - Add a condition to handle opening parentheses and push them onto the `opstack`.\n\n3. The `shunting_yard` function doesn't handle the case when the `token` is a closing parenthesis `)`. According to the Shunting Yard algorithm, when a closing parenthesis is encountered, operators should be popped from the `opstack` and appended to `rpntokens` until an opening parenthesis is found.\n   - Add a condition to handle closing parentheses, pop operators from `opstack` until the corresponding opening parenthesis is found, and append them to `rpntokens`.\n\n4. The variable names `rpntokens` and `opstack` are not very descriptive and may not clearly convey their purpose to other developers.\n   - Consider renaming `rpntokens` to something like `output_queue` or `postfix_tokens`.\n   - Consider renaming `opstack` to something like `operator_stack`.\n\nBUG\n1. The `shunting_yard` function enters an infinite loop if the `opstack` is not empty and the precedence of the current token is greater than the precedence of the top operator in the `opstack`. This is because the token is not pushed onto the `opstack` in this case.\n   - Add a condition to push the current token onto the `opstack` if the precedence of the token is greater than the precedence of the top operator in the `opstack`.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 4",
