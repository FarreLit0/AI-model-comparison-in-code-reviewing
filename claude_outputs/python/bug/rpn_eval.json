Explanation:\n   - The function `op` is defined inside the `rpn_eval` function, which is unnecessary.\n   - Defining functions inside other functions can lead to decreased readability and performance.\n   - Move the `op` function outside of the `rpn_eval` function to improve code structure and readability.\n\nBUG\n2. Explanation:\n   - The `op` function assumes that the operands `a` and `b` are always available on the stack.\n   - If there are insufficient operands on the stack, the `stack.pop()` operations will raise an `IndexError`.\n   - Add a check to ensure that there are at least two elements on the stack before performing the operations.\n\nBUG\n3. Explanation:\n   - The code assumes that the input `tokens` list contains only valid tokens (floats and supported operators).\n   - If an unsupported token is encountered, a `KeyError` will be raised when accessing the dictionary in the `op` function.\n   - Add error handling to gracefully handle unsupported tokens and provide appropriate feedback to the user.\n\nQUALITY\n4. Explanation:\n   - The variable names `a` and `b` in the `op` function and the `rpn_eval` function are not descriptive.\n   - Using single-letter variable names can make the code less readable and harder to understand.\n   - Use more descriptive variable names, such as `operand1` and `operand2`, to improve code clarity.\n\nQUALITY\n5. Explanation:\n   - The `op` function uses a dictionary to map symbols to lambda functions, which can be less efficient than using conditional statements.\n   - Using a dictionary lookup for each operation can impact performance, especially for large expressions.\n   - Consider replacing the dictionary with conditional statements (`if-elif`) to improve performance.\n\nTotal bugs: 2\nTotal quality issues: 3",
