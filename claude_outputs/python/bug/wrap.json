  "response": "1. QUALITY - Inconsistent whitespace: The code uses a mix of 4 spaces and no spaces for indentation. It's recommended to use consistent indentation (usually 4 spaces) for better readability and adherence to PEP 8 guidelines.\n\n2. BUG - Incomplete function: The function doesn't handle the case when there's remaining text shorter than or equal to the specified number of columns. This will result in the last line being omitted from the output. To fix this, add `lines.append(text.strip())` after the while loop to include the remaining text as the last line.\n\n3. QUALITY - Unclear variable names: The variable names `cols` and `end` are not very descriptive. More meaningful names like `max_width` and `break_index` would improve code readability and make the purpose of these variables clearer.\n\n4. QUALITY - Lack of comments or docstring: The function doesn't have a docstring or comments explaining its purpose, input parameters, and return value. Adding a docstring and inline comments would make the code more understandable and maintainable.\n\n5. QUALITY - Inefficient string slicing: The line `line, text = text[:end], text[end:]` creates new string objects by slicing the `text` string. This can be inefficient for large strings. Consider using string views or indexes to avoid creating new string objects unnecessarily.\n\n6. QUALITY - No error handling: The function assumes that the input `text` is a string and `cols` is a positive integer. It doesn't handle cases where the input might be of the wrong type or invalid. Adding input validation and error handling would make the function more robust.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 5",
