  "response": "Bugs:\nNo bugs found.\n\nCode quality issues:\n1. The function name 'next_palindrome' doesn't clearly convey what the function does. A more descriptive name like 'increment_palindrome' or 'find_next_palindrome' would be better.\n   Explanation:\n   - The current name doesn't clearly indicate the purpose of the function.\n   - A clearer name would improve code readability and maintainability.\n   - Rename the function to something more descriptive.\n\n2. The variables 'high_mid' and 'low_mid' are not very intuitive names. More descriptive names like 'left_index' and 'right_index' would be clearer.\n   Explanation:\n   - The current variable names don't clearly convey their purpose.\n   - More descriptive names would make the code easier to understand.\n   - Rename the variables to something more intuitive.\n\n3. The magic number '9' is used without any explanation of its significance. Using a constant with a descriptive name would improve code clarity.\n   Explanation:\n   - Using a magic number without explanation makes the code harder to understand.\n   - Replacing it with a constant and a descriptive name would improve readability.\n   - Define a constant like 'MAX_DIGIT = 9' and use it instead of the magic number.\n\n4. The expression '(len(digit_list) - 1) * [0]' is used to create a list of zeros. Using '[0] * (len(digit_list) - 1)' would be more idiomatic.\n   Explanation:\n   - The current expression is not the most common way to create a list of zeros in Python.\n   - Using the more idiomatic expression would make the code more readable to other Python developers.\n   - Change the expression to '[0] * (len(digit_list) - 1)'.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 4",
