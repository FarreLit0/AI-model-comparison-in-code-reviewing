  "response": "1. Category: BUG\n   Explanation:\n   - The default argument `data=[]` is mutable and will be shared across all function calls.\n   - This can lead to unexpected behavior where the list keeps growing with each function call.\n   - To fix it, use `None` as the default argument and create a new list inside the function if `data` is `None`.\n\n2. Category: QUALITY\n   Explanation:\n   - The variable name `val` is not descriptive and does not convey the purpose of the value being stored.\n   - Using a more meaningful name like `item` or `value` would improve code readability.\n   - Rename `val` to a more descriptive name that reflects its purpose.\n\n3. Category: QUALITY\n   Explanation:\n   - The variable `tmp` is assigned a value but never used in the function.\n   - Unused variables can clutter the code and make it harder to understand.\n   - Remove the unused variable `tmp` to improve code clarity.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 2",
