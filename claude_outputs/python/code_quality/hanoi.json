A more descriptive name like \"tower_of_hanoi\" or \"solve_hanoi\" would improve code readability and convey the purpose of the function more clearly.\n   - Explanation: The current function name \"hanoi\" does not provide enough information about what the function does. A more descriptive name would make the code easier to understand at a glance.\n   - Fix: Rename the function to \"tower_of_hanoi\" or \"solve_hanoi\".\n\n2. The parameter names \"start\" and \"end\" are not very clear about what they represent. More descriptive names like \"start_peg\" and \"end_peg\" would improve code clarity.\n   - Explanation: The parameter names \"start\" and \"end\" do not provide enough context about what they represent. Using more descriptive names would make the code more self-explanatory.\n   - Fix: Rename the parameters to \"start_peg\" and \"end_peg\".\n\n3. The line `helper = ({1, 2, 3} - {start} - {end}).pop()` is a bit complex and can be simplified for better readability.\n   - Explanation: The current line of code is a bit hard to understand at first glance. It can be simplified to improve code clarity.\n   - Fix: Replace the line with `helper = (6 - start - end)` which achieves the same result in a more readable way.\n\n4. The function lacks documentation or comments explaining its purpose, parameters, and return value.\n   - Explanation: Without proper documentation or comments, it may be difficult for other developers (or even the original author) to understand what the function does, what the parameters represent, and what the function returns.\n   - Fix: Add a docstring or comments to the function explaining its purpose, the meaning of the parameters, and the expected return value.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 4",
