  "response": "BUGS:\n1. The variable 'milliseconds_as_int_' is not initialized before being used in the cast_dur section. This can lead to undefined behavior.\n   Fix: Initialize 'milliseconds_as_int_' before using it in the cast.\n\nQUALITY ISSUES:\n1. The variable names 'start2', 'end2', 'start3', 'end3', 'd3', 'auto_duration', 'seconds_as_double', 'milliseconds_as_int_', 'hours_as_int', 'seconds_as_double_3', 'milliseconds_as_int_3', and 'hours_as_int3' are not descriptive enough. Using more meaningful names would improve code readability.\n   Fix: Use more descriptive variable names that convey their purpose.\n\n2. The comments '[system_clock Modern C++ System Clock', '[dur Duration represented with the default duration type', '[double_dur Duration represented with double, ratio in seconds', '[int_milli Duration represented with int, ratio in milliseconds', '[cast_dur Cast duration (double, seconds) to duration (int, milliseconds)', '[ratio Using ratio directly', '[steady Modern C++ Steady Clock', '[dur_steady Duration represented with the default duration type', '[time_double Time in seconds as double', '[time_milli_steady Time in milliseconds as int', '[ratio_steady Time in hours as int', and '[parsing \"Parsing\" time' are not closed properly with a corresponding ']' character. This can make the code harder to read and maintain.\n   Fix: Close the comments with the corresponding ']' character.\n\n3. The 'very_expensive_function()' is called twice, once with the system clock and once with the steady clock. This duplicates the functionality and increases the execution time unnecessarily.\n   Fix: Call 'very_expensive_function()' only once and measure the time using both clocks.\n\n4. The 'constexpr int seconds_per_hour = 60 * 60;' is defined within the 'main()' function. It would be better to define it as a global constant or a constexpr variable outside the function for better readability and reusability.\n   Fix: Move the definition of 'seconds_per_hour' outside the 'main()' function.\n\n5. The parsing section uses multiple 'if' statements to check if the count of each duration is greater than zero before printing. This can be simplified using a single 'if' statement with logical operators.\n   Fix: Combine the 'if' statements into a single 'if' statement using logical operators.\n\n6. The 'very_expensive_function()' uses a fixed number of iterations (5) and a fixed sleep duration (1 second). This makes the function inflexible and hard-coded.\n   Fix: Consider making the number of iterations and sleep duration configurable through function parameters.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 6",
