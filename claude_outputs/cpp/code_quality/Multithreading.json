  "response": "1. QUALITY: Inconsistent naming convention\n   - The variables use snake_case (e.g., `parallel_sum`) while the functions use camelCase (e.g., `main`).\n   - Inconsistent naming makes the code harder to read and maintain.\n   - Use a consistent naming convention throughout the codebase, such as snake_case for variables and functions.\n\n2. QUALITY: Unused headers\n   - The code includes headers like `<algorithm>`, `<functional>`, `<string>`, and `<unordered_map>` which are not used in the code.\n   - Unused headers can increase compilation time and make the code harder to understand.\n   - Remove the unused headers to improve code clarity and compilation speed.\n\n3. QUALITY: Inconsistent spacing\n   - The code has inconsistent spacing around operators and brackets.\n   - Inconsistent spacing makes the code harder to read and maintain.\n   - Use consistent spacing, such as spaces around operators and after commas, to improve code readability.\n\n4. QUALITY: Unnecessary comments\n   - The code has comments like `//[thread Launch thread`, which do not provide useful information.\n   - Unnecessary comments clutter the code and make it harder to read.\n   - Remove unnecessary comments and use meaningful comments to explain complex or non-obvious code.\n\n5. QUALITY: Inefficient parallel algorithm\n   - The `parallel_sum` function creates a new thread for each subproblem, which can be inefficient for small problems.\n   - Creating and managing threads has overhead, and using too many threads can reduce performance.\n   - Use a thread pool or limit the number of threads based on the problem size and available resources.\n\n6. BUG: Potential race condition\n   - The `parallel_sum` function modifies the shared variable `sum` from multiple threads without synchronization.\n   - Modifying shared data from multiple threads without proper synchronization can lead to race conditions and incorrect results.\n   - Use synchronization primitives like mutexes or atomics to ensure thread-safe access to shared data.\n\n7. QUALITY: Inefficient busy-waiting\n   - The code uses a busy-waiting loop to wait for the future in `f2.wait_for(...)`.\n   - Busy-waiting wastes CPU cycles and can reduce overall performance.\n   - Use a condition variable or a blocking wait to efficiently wait for the future without consuming CPU resources.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 6",
