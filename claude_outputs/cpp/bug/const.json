  "response": "1. QUALITY - Missing space after 'iostream' in the include statement. It should be '#include <iostream>'.\n2. QUALITY - Unnecessary use of 'using namespace std;'. It is generally discouraged to bring the entire namespace into the global scope.\n3. QUALITY - Inconsistent indentation in the code. The code inside the structs and the main function should be indented consistently for better readability.\n4. QUALITY - Missing 'override' keyword in the 'whoami' function of struct D. It is a good practice to use 'override' to ensure that the function is indeed overriding a virtual function from the base class.\n5. QUALITY - Missing 'const' keyword in the 'whoami' function of struct D. Since the function doesn't modify the object, it should be declared as 'const' to match the declaration in the base class.\n6. QUALITY - Unnecessary use of pointer in 'B *b = &d;'. It can be simplified to 'B& b = d;' to avoid using a pointer.\n7. QUALITY - Unnecessary use of pointer in 'D *dd = &d;'. It can be simplified to 'D& dd = d;' to avoid using a pointer.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 7",
