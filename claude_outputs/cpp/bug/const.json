It should be declared as 'void whoami() const' to maintain consistency with the base class and to indicate that the function does not modify the object.\nFix: Add the 'const' qualifier to the 'whoami' function in struct D.\n\n2. Code quality issue: The code is using 'endl' instead of '\\n' to print a newline character. While 'endl' is functionally correct, it also flushes the output buffer, which can impact performance. If flushing is not explicitly required, it's better to use '\\n'.\nFix: Replace 'endl' with '\\n' in the 'whoami' functions.\n\n3. Code quality issue: The code is using raw pointers instead of smart pointers or references. Raw pointers can lead to potential memory leaks and make the code more error-prone.\nFix: Consider using smart pointers (e.g., std::unique_ptr or std::shared_ptr) or references to manage object ownership and prevent memory leaks.\n\n4. Code quality issue: The code is not following the best practices for naming variables. The variable names 'b' and 'dd' are not descriptive and do not convey their purpose clearly.\nFix: Use more meaningful and descriptive names for the variables, such as 'basePtr' for 'b' and 'derivedPtr' for 'dd'.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 4",
