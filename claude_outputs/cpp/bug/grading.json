  "response": "1. QUALITY - Poor naming: The function name \"grade\" does not clearly convey its purpose. A better name would be \"calculateGrade\" or \"computeGrade\".\n\n2. BUG - Incorrect calculation: The formula for calculating the mark in the \"grade\" function is incorrect. It should be \"test + exam\" instead of \"test + 70 * exam / 50\".\n\n3. BUG - Syntax error: The \"Return\" keyword in the \"grade\" function should be lowercase \"return\".\n\n4. QUALITY - Inconsistent formatting: The indentation and spacing in the code are inconsistent, making it harder to read and maintain. Consistent formatting should be used throughout the code.\n\n5. BUG - Missing function parameter type: The \"getMark\" function is missing the type for the \"maxMark\" parameter. It should be \"double getMark(double maxMark)\".\n\n6. BUG - Incorrect loop condition: The condition in the while loop of the \"getMark\" function should be \"theMark < 0. || theMark > maxMark\" to check if the mark is outside the valid range.\n\n7. QUALITY - Redundant code: The error message and prompt for input are repeated inside the while loop of the \"getMark\" function. They should be moved outside the loop to avoid unnecessary repetition.\n\n8. BUG - Incorrect input operator: The \"cin\" operator in the \"getMark\" function should be followed by \">>\" instead of \"<<\" to read input from the user.\n\n9. QUALITY - Missing input validation: The \"getMark\" function does not validate the input before returning the mark. It should check if the input was successful using \"cin.fail()\" and handle invalid input appropriately.\n\n10. QUALITY - Missing error handling: The code does not handle potential errors, such as invalid input or division by zero. Appropriate error handling should be added to provide informative error messages and prevent unexpected behavior.\n\nTotal bugs: 5\nTotal quality issues: 5",
