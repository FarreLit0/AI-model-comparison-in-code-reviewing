Category: QUALITY\n   - Poor class name: The class name JavaClean01_Addition does not follow standard Java naming conventions and includes unnecessary prefixes.\n   - Using descriptive and concise names and following naming conventions improves readability and maintainability.\n   - Rename the class to a more appropriate name, such as Addition, without any prefixes.\n\n2. Category: QUALITY\n   - Lack of constructor: The class does not have a private constructor to prevent instantiation.\n   - For utility classes containing only static methods, it's a good practice to have a private constructor to avoid creating instances.\n   - Add a private constructor: `private Addition() {}`\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 2",
