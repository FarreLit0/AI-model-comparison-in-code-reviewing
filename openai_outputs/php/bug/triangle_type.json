  "response": "1. Category: BUG\n   - Explanation:\n     - Issue: The `if` and `elseif` conditions use the assignment operator `=` instead of the comparison operator `==`.\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: Using `=` instead of `==` causes unexpected behaviors since variables are assigned new values rather than being compared.\n     - How to fix it: Replace the assignment operator `=` with the comparison operator `==`.\n\n2. Category: QUALTIY\n   - Explanation:\n     - Issue: The function does not explicitly define a data type for its parameters.\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: Lack of type declarations may lead to unintended behavior if non-numeric inputs are provided.\n     - How to fix it: Define the function parameters with type declarations (e.g., `function triangleType(float $a, float $b, float $c)`).\n\n3. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - Issue: Lack of curly braces `{}` for the control structures (`if`, `elseif`, `else`).\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: Omitting braces can lead to errors or unintended behavior if additional statements are included without proper grouping.\n     - How to fix it: Use curly braces `{}` to define the block of statements for each control structure.\n\n4. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - Issue: Use of vague return values like \"Invalid\".\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: The return value \"Invalid\" is not descriptive. It doesn\u2019t convey if the function encountered non-triangle side lengths.\n     - How to fix it: Consider more descriptive return values or use exceptions to handle invalid input scenarios.\n\n5. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - Issue: The function lacks comments or documentation.\n     - Why it\u2019s a problem: Absence of comments can make the code harder to understand and maintain, especially for others or in the future.\n     - How to fix it: Add comments or PHPDoc to explain the purpose and functionality of the function.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 4",
