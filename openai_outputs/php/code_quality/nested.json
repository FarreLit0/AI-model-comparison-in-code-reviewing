  "response": "1. Category: BUG\n   Explanation:\n   - The function only outputs \"Even\" but has no output for odd numbers or values outside the range (0, 100).\n   - This is a problem as users won't know if the function is working correctly for other inputs.\n   - To fix it, add additional conditions and outputs, such as for odd numbers or values outside the specified range.\n\n2. Category: CODE QUALITY\n   Explanation:\n   - The function uses nested if statements unnecessarily, making it hard to read.\n   - This is a problem as it reduces readability and maintainability.\n   - To fix it, refactor the function using logical operators (&&), e.g., if ($x > 0 && $x < 100 && $x % 2 === 0).\n\n3. Category: CODE QUALITY\n   Explanation:\n   - The function name, `check`, is vague and does not describe what is being checked.\n   - This is a problem because it makes the code harder to understand for someone who did not write it.\n   - To fix it, use a descriptive function name like `isEvenWithinRange`.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 2",
