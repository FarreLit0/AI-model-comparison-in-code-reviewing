Modern C++ offers smart pointers (e.g., `std::unique_ptr` or `std::shared_ptr`) that automatically manage memory and help prevent such issues.\n   - Fix by replacing raw pointers with smart pointers, which manage memory automatically.\n\n2. Explanation:\n   - Use of dynamic array with `new`.\n   - Raw dynamic arrays are error-prone and less safe. C++ provides the `std::vector` class as a safer and more versatile alternative for working with dynamic arrays.\n   - Fix by using `std::vector<int>` to replace the dynamic array managed by `new`.\n\n3. Explanation:\n   - Redundant check for `x` before dereferencing.\n   - The check `if (x)` is redundant because `x` is guaranteed to be non-null after allocation.\n   - Fix by directly printing `*x`.\n\n4. Explanation:\n   - Commenting style using old-fashioned methods.\n   - Comments should ideally be self-explanatory and use modern conventions such as `//` for single-line comments or `/** */` for Doxygen-style documentation.\n   - This can be improved by updating comments to be more descriptive and to follow consistent conventions.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 4",
