  "response": "1. Category: BUG\n   - Explanation:\n     - The issue is that the remaining part of the text after the loop ends is not handled. If there is any text left that is shorter than `cols`, it will not be included in the returned list.\n     - This is a problem because any remaining text that doesn't end in a space will be omitted from the output, leading to incomplete wrapping.\n     - To fix it, add an additional step after the loop to append the remaining part of the text to `lines`.\n\n2. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - The issue is the variable name `wrap`. The name can be misleading as it implies that the text will be wrapped and joined, but the function actually breaks the text into lines based on a given width.\n     - Misleading names reduce code readability and can cause confusion about what the function does.\n     - To fix it, rename the function to something more descriptive like `wrap_text_to_lines`.\n\n3. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation:\n     - The variables `line` and `text` are reassigned in a single line without clear context, which can reduce readability.\n     - This could be improved for clarity, as complex reassignment can be confusing.\n     - To fix it, assign `line` and `text` separately for better clarity and understanding of the code.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 2",
