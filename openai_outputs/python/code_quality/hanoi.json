Category: QUALITY\n   Explanation:\n   - What the issue is: The use of a set comprehension `{1, 2, 3} - {start} - {end}` to determine the helper pole is unnecessary overhead.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: This creates a new set and performs multiple set operations every time the helper value needs to be calculated, which can be inefficient and less readable.\n   - How to fix it: Use a simple calculation or a direct conditional check to determine the helper pole more efficiently, such as using `helper = 6 - start - end` as there are always exactly three poles labeled 1, 2, and 3.\n\n2. Category: QUALITY\n   Explanation:\n   - What the issue is: The variable name `helper` is not very descriptive.\n   - Why it\u2019s a problem: Code readability and maintainability are reduced as it isn't immediately clear what role `helper` plays without understanding the logic.\n   - How to fix it: Rename the variable to a more descriptive name like `auxiliary` or `intermediate_pole` to clarify its role in the algorithm.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 2",
