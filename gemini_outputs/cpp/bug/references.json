After this line, both `ppr` and `prr` become dangling references, as they are referencing memory that has been freed. Accessing them after the `delete` operation results in undefined behavior.\n   Why it’s a problem: Accessing dangling references leads to unpredictable behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.\n   How to fix it: Do not delete `p` before the references are no longer needed. If the allocated memory needs to be freed, ensure that the references are no longer in use or are reassigned to valid memory locations. In this example the `delete p;` should be removed, as we don't need to dynamically allocate memory in the first place. If dynamic allocation is needed, ensure that the memory pointed to by `p` is only deleted after `ppr` and `prr` are no longer used, and assign `nullptr` to `p`, `ppr`, and `prr` after deleting `p`.\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n1. Explanation: The comments such as `//[stack References to stack value` are unnecessary and distracting.\n   Why it’s a problem: They don't add any value and clutter the code.\n   How to fix it: Remove the unnecessary comments.\n\n2. Explanation: The dynamic allocation of `int *p = new int(3);` is unnecessary.\n   Why it’s a problem: Dynamic allocation should only be used when the size of the memory required isn't known at compile time or when the lifetime of the variable exceeds the scope in which it's created. In this example a plain `int p = 3;` would be more suitable.\n   How to fix it: Replace `int *p = new int(3);` with `int p = 3;` and remove `delete p;`.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 2",
