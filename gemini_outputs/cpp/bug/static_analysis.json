This is undefined behavior and can lead to crashes or memory corruption.\nHow to fix it: Use `delete symbol;` to deallocate the memory.\n\n2. Category: BUG\nExplanation: `memleak` allocates memory using `new int`, `malloc(10)`, and `new int[10]`, but never deallocates it. This results in a memory leak, where the allocated memory is no longer accessible but is still reserved, eventually leading to program instability.\nHow to fix it: Deallocate the memory using `delete number;`, `free(buff);`, and `delete[] number_array;` at the end of the function.\n\n3. Category: BUG\nExplanation: `static_array_out_of_bounds` accesses the `array` at index 11, which is outside the bounds of the array (0-9). This is undefined behavior and can lead to crashes or unexpected results.\nHow to fix it: Ensure the index `i` stays within the bounds of the array by checking `i < 10` before accessing `array[i]`.\n\n4. Category: BUG\nExplanation: `dynamic_array_out_of_bounds` allocates an array of 10 integers but then attempts to access element at index 11, which is out of bounds, leading to undefined behavior.\nHow to fix it: Ensure that index `i` remains within bounds (i.e., i < 10).\n\n5. Category: BUG\nExplanation: `dereferencing_null_pointer` attempts to dereference a null pointer `number`, causing a crash.\nHow to fix it: Ensure that the pointer is not null before attempting to dereference it. In the `dereferencing_null_pointer_complex` function, there is a similar bug. Even if `obj` is NULL, the code proceeds to `done` label and dereferences a null pointer.\nHow to fix it: Remove `obj->value = 2;` or add an `if` statement:\n```c++\ndone:\n    if (obj != NULL)\n      obj->value = 2;\n```\n\n6. Category: BUG\nExplanation: `bad_free` attempts to deallocate memory allocated with `new` using `free` and memory allocated with `malloc` using `delete`. `new` and `delete` are C++ operators and `malloc` and `free` are c functions. Using the wrong deallocation function leads to undefined behavior such as memory corruption.\nHow to fix it: `free(m)` should be `free(m)` and `free(n)` should be `delete n`.\n\n7. Category: QUALITY\nExplanation: The lines `buff = buff;`, `number = number;` and `number_array = number_array;` in `memleak` have no effect and are unnecessary.\nHow to fix it: Remove these lines.\n\nTotal bugs: 6\nTotal quality issues: 1",
