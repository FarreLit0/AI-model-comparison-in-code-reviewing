Category: QUALITY\n   Explanation:\n   - The `whoami` method in struct `D` overrides the virtual function from struct `B`, but it's missing the `const` keyword.\n   - This is a problem because while technically it overrides the base class method, the `const` correctness of base class references/pointers calling `whoami` is violated. The code will still work in this specific case, but if the base class pointer was `const B*`, it could not call the non-`const` version in the derived class.\n   - To fix it, add the `const` keyword to the `whoami` method in struct `D`: `void whoami() const`.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 1",
