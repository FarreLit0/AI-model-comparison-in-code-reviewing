Explanation: Modifying a vector while iterating through it using iterators can invalidate the iterators, leading to undefined behavior such as crashes, data corruption, or infinite loops.\n   - Why it’s a problem: The `push_back(5)` inside the loop can cause the vector to reallocate its underlying memory if the vector's current capacity is reached. This reallocation invalidates all iterators pointing into the vector, including `i`. After invalidation, `i++` attempts to advance the iterator, but it now points to memory that is no longer valid, resulting in undefined behavior.\n   - How to fix it: Avoid modifying the vector while iterating through it using iterators. One way to achieve this is to collect the elements to be added in a separate vector and add them to the original vector after the iteration is complete. Alternatively, use indices instead of iterators. Or, if adding elements at the end is necessary, iterate in reverse.\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n1. Explanation: Using `using namespace std;` is generally considered bad practice, especially in header files or large projects.\n   - Why it’s a problem: It pollutes the global namespace, potentially leading to naming conflicts with other libraries or user-defined code.\n   - How to fix it: Qualify standard library elements with `std::`, e.g., `std::vector`, `std::cout`.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 1",
