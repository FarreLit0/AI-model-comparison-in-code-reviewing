Therefore, the `if` condition will always be false. This means that the code inside the `if` block, which intends to print the type name, will never be executed.\nWhy itâ€™s a problem: The program's logic is flawed, and it fails to execute code that's supposed to run under certain conditions.\nHow to fix it: Remove the `!` operator so that the code inside the `if` block only executes when `s2` does not have a value.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 0",
