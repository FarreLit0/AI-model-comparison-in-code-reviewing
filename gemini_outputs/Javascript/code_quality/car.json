The `getFullName` function concatenates strings with and without spaces inconsistently (brand + ' ' + model + ' ' + 'Y: ' + year).\n   - Why it’s a problem: It affects readability and maintainability. It's best to be consistent.\n   - How to fix it: Use consistent spacing. For example: `return this.brand + ' ' + this.model + ' Y: ' + this.year;`\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n2. Explanation: Hardcoded price values in `calculatePrice` function. The prices are hardcoded strings, making them difficult to change and not representative of a real calculation.\n   - Why it’s a problem: It limits the function's flexibility and realism. A more dynamic price calculation would be preferable.\n   - How to fix it: Use a more complex calculation based on the year and other factors (e.g., a base price adjusted by year and other attributes). Returning a number instead of a string would also allow greater flexibility for future price manipulations.\n\nCategory: BUG\n3. Explanation: The `tuneCar` function sets the `year` property to the string \"2011\" instead of the number 2011.\n   - Why it’s a problem: This changes the data type of the `year` property, which could cause issues in other parts of the code that expect it to be a number.\n   - How to fix it: Change `this.year = '2011';` to `this.year = 2011;`\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n4. Explanation: Inconsistent return types in `calculatePrice`. It returns a string with a dollar sign. Returning a number would allow for calculations.\n   - Why it’s a problem: Returning a string prevents consumers of this code from performing numerical calculations on the value.\n   - How to fix it: Return a numerical value from the function (e.g. 1500, 30000, etc). Let the code that consumes this value format it as a string for display purposes.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 4",
