It only logs it to the console.\nWhy it’s a problem: The caller of the function has no way to access or use the moved elements, rendering the function largely useless.\nHow to fix it: Add a `return arr;` statement at the end of the function.\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n1. Explanation: The function modifies the input array `arr` directly through reassignment.\nWhy it’s a problem: This can lead to unexpected side effects if the caller expects the original array to remain unchanged. It breaks the principle of immutability when it is not expected.\nHow to fix it: Create a new array instead of reassigning the input array, and return the new array.\n\n2. Explanation: Variable name `x` is not descriptive.\nWhy it’s a problem: It makes it harder to understand the purpose of the variable.\nHow to fix it: Rename `x` to something more descriptive like `numberOfElementsToMove`.\n\n3. Explanation: Variable name `k` in the calling code is not descriptive.\nWhy it’s a problem: It makes it harder to understand the purpose of the variable.\nHow to fix it: Rename `k` to something more descriptive like `numberOfElementsToMove`.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 3",
