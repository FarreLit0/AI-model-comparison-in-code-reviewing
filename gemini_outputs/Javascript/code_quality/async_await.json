Explanation: Unnecessary variable declarations. `first`, `second`, and `third` are declared outside the promise chain, even though they are only used within it.\n   - Why it’s a problem: It reduces code readability and increases the scope of the variables unnecessarily.\n   - How to fix it: Declare `first`, `second`, and `third` within the first `.then()` block, or better yet, avoid them entirely using intermediate return values.\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n2. Explanation: Missing error handling. The code doesn't handle potential errors in the `random()` function or within the promise chain.\n   - Why it’s a problem: If `random()` rejects, the promise chain will be broken, and no error will be logged, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.\n   - How to fix it: Add a `.catch()` block at the end of the promise chain to handle any rejections.\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n3. Explanation: Inconsistent formatting. The code uses inconsistent spacing.\n   - Why it’s a problem: Makes the code harder to read and understand.\n   - How to fix it: Apply a consistent formatting style throughout the code.\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n4. Explanation: The `random` function name is too generic.\n   - Why it’s a problem: If the function name `random` is used elsewhere in the codebase, it could cause confusion or naming conflicts.\n   - How to fix it: Rename it to something more specific, like `getRandomPromise` or `asyncRandomNumber`.\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n5. Explanation: The last `.then` is only for logging.\n   - Why it’s a problem: The last `.then` block doesn't return anything. It is used only for printing to console. In such cases `.finally` may be more appropriate.\n   - How to fix it: `.finally` can be used to replace the last `.then` block for logging.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 5",
