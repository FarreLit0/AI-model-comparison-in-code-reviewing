Category: BUG\n- Explanation: `foo`, `bar`, and `baz` are undefined variables.\n- Why it’s a problem: The code will throw a `ReferenceError` because you're trying to log variables that have not been declared or initialized. The `console.log` and `console.table` statements will fail.\n- How to fix it: Declare and initialize `foo`, `bar`, and `baz` before using them, or remove the `console.log` and `console.table` statements if they are not needed. For example: `let foo = 1; let bar = 2; let baz = 3;`\n\n2. Category: CODE QUALITY\n- Explanation: Calling `deleteMe()` twice might not be the intended behaviour. There's no indication in the code what the purpose of tracing the `deleteMe` function is.\n- Why it’s a problem: Calling the function multiple times without understanding the intended side-effect.\n- How to fix it: Evaluate if the function should be called twice. If it is required it's fine, otherwise, remove the duplicated call.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 1",
