  "response": "1. QUALITY\n  - Explanation: Unnecessary file extension in `require(\"through2\").obj`. `through2`'s `obj` property is directly accessible and does not need to be treated as a separate file.\n  - Why it’s a problem: It adds unnecessary characters and might confuse some readers.\n  - How to fix it: Change to `require(\"through2\").obj;`\n\n2. QUALITY\n  - Explanation: The code conditionally chooses between `./README.md` and a language-specific README file but doesn't provide a fallback if the language normalization fails or results in an invalid name.\n  - Why it’s a problem: While the `fs.stat` check handles the non-existent translation, a more robust approach could normalize the language code more defensively.\n  - How to fix it: Add a check after the language normalization to see if the constructed file path is valid before `fs.stat`.\n\n3. QUALITY\n    - Explanation: The code creates a new array named `message` inside the transform function of the `through2` object stream on every chunk. Only one update message is needed.\n    - Why it’s a problem: Creating the array for every chunk processed is wasteful and inefficient.\n    - How to fix it: Move the `message` array declaration outside the transform function, before the stream pipeline begins. Create the message only once and pass it if the update is available.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 3",
