  "response": "1. Category: BUG\n   - Explanation: The `isPrime` function modifies the `arr` (vecOfPrimes) array directly within the `every` callback's `result` check. This means that while `every` is iterating, the array is being modified, leading to potentially incorrect prime detection because the `every` function does not account for the newly added element. This can lead to non-prime numbers being added to the `vecOfPrimes` array.\n   - Why it’s a problem: The array modification during the `every` iteration violates the principle of not modifying data structures while iterating over them, and leads to incorrect results.\n   - How to fix it: Separate the prime check from the array modification. Store the result of the every check in a variable, and only push the number to the array if the every check passed outside the `every` callback. Also, the return in the isPrime function must return true or false and not the remainder of number % e.\n\n2. Category: BUG\n   - Explanation: The loop condition `vecOfPrimes.length < 10001` limits the number of primes generated regardless of the input `n`. If `n` is large, the `vecOfPrimes` array might not contain all the primes needed to calculate the sum of primes less than `n`.\n   - Why it’s a problem: The function does not generate enough primes to correctly calculate the prime summation for large values of `n`. It becomes inaccurate for inputs where the 10001st prime is smaller than n, which will happen often with increasing n.\n   - How to fix it: Remove the length limit from the `for` loop condition and find another way to stop the prime generation. A better approach is to continue generating primes until the largest prime in vecOfPrimes is greater or equal to `n`.\n\n3. Category: BUG\n    - Explanation: The return statement in `isPrime` function implicitly returns `undefined` if the `result` is false, as there is no explicit `return` statement in the `else` block.\n    - Why it's a problem: Although `isPrime` doesn't explicitly return a boolean, the logic relies on the side effect of pushing a number to the `vecOfPrimes` array. However, for code clarity and predictability, it's always better to explicitly return `true` if a number is prime and `false` otherwise.\n    - How to fix it: Add an explicit `return false` if result is false to indicate that the number is not prime. However, with the fixes implemented in Bug 1, the return of a boolean in the `isPrime` function is unnecessary.\n\n4. Category: QUALITY\n    - Explanation: The `isPrime` function name is misleading because it doesn't return a boolean value indicating whether a number is prime. Instead, it mutates the input array `arr` by adding a number to it if it's prime.\n    - Why it’s a problem: Misleading function names make code harder to understand and can lead to unexpected behavior.\n    - How to fix it: Rename the function to something that accurately reflects its behavior, like `addPrimeIfAbsent`.\n\n5. Category: QUALITY\n    - Explanation: Using `var` for the `result` and `filtered` variables is outdated.\n    - Why it’s a problem: `var` has function scope, which can lead to unexpected behavior and make it harder to reason about the code. `let` and `const` have block scope, which is generally preferred.\n    - How to fix it: Replace `var` with `const` or `let` depending on whether the variable is reassigned.\n\n6. Category: QUALITY\n    - Explanation: The code lacks comments explaining the purpose of each section, especially the prime generation and summation logic.\n    - Why it's a problem: Makes the code harder to understand and maintain, especially for others or the original author after some time.\n    - How to fix it: Add comments to explain the logic and purpose of each section of the code.\n\nTotal bugs: 3\nTotal quality issues: 3",
