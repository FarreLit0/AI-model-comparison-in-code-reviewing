Reassigning a `const` variable will result in a runtime error.\n  - Why it’s a problem: The code will throw an error and the intended logic of using \"Anonymous\" as a default name won't execute.\n  - How to fix it: Declare `name` using `let` instead of `const` so it can be reassigned.\n\n2. Category: BUG\n- Explanation:\n  - The `greeting` variable is reassigned inside the `greet` function's scope, but it's declared using `const`. Reassigning a `const` variable will result in a runtime error.\n  - Why it’s a problem: The code will throw an error and the intended logic of using \"Hello\" as a default greeting won't execute.\n  - How to fix it: Declare `greeting` using `let` instead of `const` so it can be reassigned.\n\n3. Category: BUG\n- Explanation:\n  - The condition `greeting = undefined` uses assignment (`=`) instead of comparison (`===` or `==`). This will always assign `undefined` to `greeting` and the condition will evaluate to `undefined`, which is falsy.\n  - Why it’s a problem: The intended check for an undefined greeting will not work correctly. Even if a valid greeting is provided, it will be overwritten with `undefined`, and the `if` statement will always treat it as if it's undefined.\n  - How to fix it: Use strict equality `===` or loose equality `==` instead of assignment: `greeting === undefined` or `greeting == undefined`.\n\n4. Category: BUG\n- Explanation:\n  - The return statement uses template literals incorrectly. Template literals require backticks (` `` `), not single quotes (`''`). Also, even with backticks, the variables `greeting` and `name` won't be interpolated because the backticks are escaped with a backslash `\\`.\n  - Why it’s a problem: The greeting will not be formatted correctly. The output will literally be the string \"${greeting}, ${name}!\" instead of interpolating the variables.\n  - How to fix it: Use backticks instead of single quotes to define the template literal and remove the unnecessary escaping backslashes: `\\`${greeting}, ${name}!\\``\n\n5. Category: BUG\n- Explanation:\n  - When the `Greeter` object is instantiated, only one argument is passed `new Greeter(\"Hi\")`. The constructor expects two arguments. `greeting` will be undefined.\n  - Why it’s a problem: Since only one argument is passed to the constructor, the greeting property will be `undefined`, leading to unexpected behavior in the greet function.\n  - How to fix it: Pass two arguments to the constructor: `new Greeter(\"Hi\", \"Hello\")`.\n\n6. Category: QUALITY\n- Explanation:\n  - Shadowing: The variables `name` and `greeting` are declared inside the `greet` method, shadowing the class properties with the same names. While this isn't necessarily a bug if handled correctly, it introduces unnecessary complexity and can easily lead to confusion and errors.\n  - Why it’s a problem: It makes the code harder to read and understand.\n  - How to fix it:  Access the class properties directly using `this.name` and `this.greeting` inside the `greet` method, and remove the unnecessary `const name = this.name` and `const greeting = this.greeting` lines.\n\nTotal bugs: 5\nTotal quality issues: 1",
