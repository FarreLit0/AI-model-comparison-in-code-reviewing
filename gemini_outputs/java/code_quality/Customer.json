  "response": "1.  QUALITY\n    - Explanation: The `joiningDate` field is mutable because it's a `java.util.Date` object, and the `getJoiningDate()` method returns a direct reference to it. This allows external code to modify the Customer's joining date without using any setter methods on the Customer class, violating encapsulation.\n    - Why it’s a problem: It breaks encapsulation and makes the class's state unpredictable and harder to reason about. External modifications can lead to unexpected behavior and make debugging difficult.\n    - How to fix it: Return a defensive copy of the `Date` object in the `getJoiningDate()` method using `return new Date(this.joiningDate.getTime());` or use immutable date time classes like those in `java.time`.\n\n2. QUALITY\n    - Explanation: The class lacks equals() and hashCode() methods.\n    - Why it’s a problem: Without these methods, comparing Customer objects for equality will rely on object identity (reference equality) rather than comparing their actual data (customerName, joiningDate). This can lead to problems if you need to use Customer objects as keys in a HashMap or HashSet or if you want to accurately compare two Customer instances for data equality.\n    - How to fix it: Override the equals() and hashCode() methods, implementing the appropriate logic to compare customerName and joiningDate for equality. Consider null checks on these fields as well.\n\n3. QUALITY\n    - Explanation: The class lacks a toString() method.\n    - Why it’s a problem: Without a toString() method, it's difficult to get a meaningful representation of a Customer object when debugging or logging. The default toString() method (inherited from Object) only prints the class name and the object's memory address, which is not helpful.\n    - How to fix it: Override the toString() method to provide a useful string representation of the Customer object, including its customerName and joiningDate.\n\n4. QUALITY\n    - Explanation: The constructor only takes the customer name as input and initializes the `joiningDate` to the current date and time. This forces the joining date to be the date the object is created and does not allow the user to specify the joining date.\n    - Why it’s a problem: It reduces flexibility.  There might be scenarios where the joining date is known beforehand, and the application needs to create `Customer` objects with historical `joiningDate` values.\n    - How to fix it: Add a second constructor that takes both `customerName` and `joiningDate` as parameters: `public Customer(String customerName, Date joiningDate) { ... }` and ensure the original constructor calls this, or provide a means of setting the date after construction.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 4",
