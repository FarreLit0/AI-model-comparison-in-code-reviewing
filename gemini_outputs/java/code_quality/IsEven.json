A more general name such as `NumberUtils` or `MathUtils` would be more suitable if the class is intended to hold other number-related utility functions in the future.\n- Why it’s a problem: If the class only contains the `isEven` method, it's fine. But if more functions will be added, a more general class name avoids having to rename the class later and potentially break existing code.\n- How to fix it: Rename the class to `NumberUtils` or `MathUtils`. Or leave it as is if no other methods are planned.\n\n2. Category: QUALITY\nExplanation:\n- What the issue is: The class is missing a private constructor.\n- Why it’s a problem: Utility classes are not meant to be instantiated. Having a public or default constructor allows instantiation, which is not necessary and could lead to misuse.\n- How to fix it: Add a private constructor to prevent instantiation: `private IsEven() {}`\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 2",
