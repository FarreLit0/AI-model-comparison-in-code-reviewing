  "response": "1. Category: QUALITY\nExplanation:\n- What the issue is: The class name \"Addition\" is too generic.\n- Why it’s a problem: It doesn't convey specific purpose if the class does more than just addition. It reduces code readability and makes it difficult to understand the specific functionality of the class if more methods are added.\n- How to fix it: Rename the class to something more descriptive if it contains more than just addition or leave it as is if only addition is performed. A good alternative could be SimpleAdder.\n\n2. Category: QUALITY\nExplanation:\n- What the issue is: The method name \"add\" is very common and could lead to naming conflicts or ambiguity in larger projects.\n- Why it’s a problem: When working on a big project with many classes and methods, having very generic names like 'add' can cause confusion and makes the code harder to understand.\n- How to fix it: If the class represents a specific context, incorporate it into the method name, such as `sum`. Otherwise keep `add`.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 2",
