Explanation: Lack of input validation.\n    - What the issue is: The function doesn't validate if the input `$n` is a non-negative integer.\n    - Why it’s a problem: Passing a negative number or a non-integer value to the function will lead to either infinite recursion (for negative numbers) or unexpected results (for non-integer values due to implicit type casting). It can also lead to stack overflow.\n    - How to fix it: Add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure that `$n` is a non-negative integer. You can use `if (!is_int($n) || $n < 0) { throw new InvalidArgumentException(\"Input must be a non-negative integer.\"); }`.\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n2. Explanation: Missing PHPDoc.\n    - What the issue is: There's no PHPDoc block to describe the function's purpose, parameters, and return value.\n    - Why it’s a problem: Makes the code harder to understand and maintain.  Tools that generate API documentation will not be able to document this function.\n    - How to fix it: Add a PHPDoc block above the function definition, for example:\n      ```php\n      /**\n       * Calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer.\n       *\n       * @param int $n The non-negative integer to calculate the factorial of.\n       * @return int The factorial of $n.\n       * @throws InvalidArgumentException If $n is not a non-negative integer.\n       */\n      ```\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 2",
