There is no code that calls the function or demonstrates its usage.\n- What the issue is: Lack of usage. The function is defined but never called or used in any way.\n- Why it’s a problem: While not technically an error, it is incomplete. A function should be called to verify functionality.\n- How to fix it: Add code that calls `is_even()` with various inputs and displays the results (e.g., using `echo` or `var_dump`).\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n2. Explanation: The code lacks any kind of documentation or comments to explain the purpose or usage of the function.\n- What the issue is: Missing documentation. There are no comments or docblocks explaining what the function `is_even` does, what its parameters are, or what it returns.\n- Why it’s a problem: Makes the code harder to understand and maintain, especially for other developers.\n- How to fix it: Add a docblock above the function definition explaining its purpose, parameters, and return value. For example:\n\n    ```php\n    /**\n     * Checks if a number is even.\n     *\n     * @param int $n The number to check.\n     *\n     * @return bool True if the number is even, false otherwise.\n     */\n    function is_even($n) {\n        return $n % 2 === 0;\n    }\n    ```\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n3. Explanation: The function definition lacks type hinting for the parameter.\n- What the issue is: Missing type hinting. The parameter `$n` does not have a type hint, making it difficult to determine the expected type for `$n`.\n- Why it’s a problem: Leads to uncertainty and potential errors. While PHP is dynamically typed, type hints improve code clarity and can help catch type-related errors early.\n- How to fix it: Add a type hint to the parameter `$n`:\n\n    ```php\n    function is_even(int $n) {\n        return $n % 2 === 0;\n    }\n    ```\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 3",
