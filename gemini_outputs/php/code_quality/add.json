Explanation: Missing PHPDoc.\n   - What the issue is: The function lacks a PHPDoc comment to describe its purpose, parameters, and return value.\n   - Why it’s a problem: This makes the code harder to understand and maintain, especially for others or when revisiting the code later. It hinders automatic documentation generation.\n   - How to fix it: Add a PHPDoc comment above the function definition explaining its functionality, parameters, and return value.\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n2. Explanation: Lack of Input validation.\n   - What the issue is: The function does not validate the input types of the arguments $a and $b.\n   - Why it’s a problem: If $a or $b are not numeric, PHP will attempt to cast them to numbers, which might lead to unexpected behavior or errors, especially with non-numeric strings.\n   - How to fix it: Add checks using `is_numeric()` or `is_int()`/`is_float()` to validate the input and throw an exception or return an error value if the inputs are invalid.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 2",
