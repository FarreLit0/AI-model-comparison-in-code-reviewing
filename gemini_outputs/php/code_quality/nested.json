Explanation: Function name \"check\" is too generic.\n   - What: The name doesn't clearly indicate what the function is checking.\n   - Why: This reduces readability and makes it harder to understand the function's purpose without examining the code.\n   - How: Rename the function to something more descriptive, such as \"printEvenIfPositiveAndLessThan100\".\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n2. Explanation: The code lacks an \"else\" condition.\n   - What: The code doesn't specify what happens if the number is not even, not positive, or greater than 100.\n   - Why: This can lead to unexpected behavior or a lack of feedback for users.\n   - How: Add 'else' conditions to provide feedback or handle other cases.  For instance, you could add `else { echo \"Odd\"; }` within the `if ($x % 2 === 0)` block, and `else { /* handle negative or zero */ }` for the outer `if ($x > 0)` condition.\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n3. Explanation: Nested 'if' statements can be simplified.\n   - What: The nested structure makes the code less readable.\n   - Why: Deeply nested conditions are harder to follow and understand.\n   - How: Combine the conditions into a single 'if' statement using the '&&' (AND) operator: `if ($x > 0 && $x < 100 && $x % 2 === 0)`.\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n4. Explanation: Missing return statement.\n   - What: The function doesn't return any value.\n   - Why: If the function is intended to be used for other purposes than just printing, then it should return a value, like a boolean indicating success or failure.  Even if only printing, consider returning a value for testability.\n   - How: Add a `return` statement, perhaps `return true;` after the `echo \"Even\";` or `return false;` otherwise.\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n5. Explanation: Lack of comments\n   - What: The function lacks comments explaining its purpose and functionality\n   - Why: Comments help other developers (or yourself in the future) understand the code more easily\n   - How: Add a docblock comment to the function:\n   ```php\n   /**\n    * Checks if a number is positive, less than 100, and even.  If so, prints \"Even\".\n    *\n    * @param int $x The number to check.\n    * @return void\n    */\n   ```\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 5",
