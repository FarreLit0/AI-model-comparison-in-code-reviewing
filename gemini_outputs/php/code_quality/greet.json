If `$name` is not a string, `htmlspecialchars` might not behave as expected, or the concatenation might result in unexpected output.\n   - Why: Input validation is crucial for security and preventing unexpected errors.\n   - How: Add a check to ensure `$name` is a string, and handle non-string inputs appropriately (e.g., throw an exception, return an error message, or type cast).\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n2. Explanation: Missing docblock.\n   - What: The function lacks a docblock explaining its purpose, parameters, and return value.\n   - Why: Docblocks are important for code maintainability, readability, and generating API documentation.\n   - How: Add a docblock above the function definition that describes its functionality, input parameter (`$name`), and return value.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 2",
