It doesn't specify what the discount applies to or the type of discount (e.g., percentage, fixed amount).\nWhy it’s a problem: Can lead to confusion and make the code less readable and maintainable. It doesn't communicate the purpose clearly.\nHow to fix it: Rename the function to something more descriptive, like \"calculatePercentageDiscount\" or \"apply15PercentDiscount.\" The best name depends on the intended use.\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n2. Explanation: The magic number 0.85 is used directly in the calculation.\nWhy it’s a problem: It's unclear what this number represents without additional context. It makes the code harder to understand and maintain. If the discount percentage changes, you have to search through the code to find and update this value.\nHow to fix it: Define a constant for the discount percentage (e.g., `const DISCOUNT_PERCENTAGE = 0.15;`) and then calculate the return value as `$price * (1 - DISCOUNT_PERCENTAGE);`.\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n3. Explanation: Lack of Input validation.\nWhy it's a problem: If $price is not a numerical value or is negative, it could lead to unexpected results, errors or vulnerabilities.\nHow to fix it: Add input validation to check if $price is numeric and non-negative, and handle invalid inputs appropriately, perhaps by throwing an exception or returning an error code.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 3",
