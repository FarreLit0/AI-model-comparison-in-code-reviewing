This will always assign \"1234\" to `$password`, making the condition always true when the username is \"admin\".\n   Why it’s a problem: It will incorrectly authenticate users who provide any password when the username is \"admin\".\n   How to fix it: Change `$password = \"1234\"` to `$password == \"1234\"`.\n\n2. Category: BUG\n   Explanation: The assignment operator `=` is used instead of the equality operator `==` in the second `if` statement's username check. This will always assign \"\" to `$username`, making the condition always true, thus returning false.\n   Why it’s a problem: Regardless of the provided username, it will return false.\n   How to fix it: Change `$username = \"\"` to `$username == \"\"`.\n\n3. Category: QUALITY\n   Explanation: The function `authenticate` could benefit from improved naming to enhance readability and maintainability.\n   Why it’s a problem: Better naming improves understanding and reduces cognitive load.\n   How to fix it: No change needed, but it is a suggestion.\n\nTotal bugs: 2\nTotal quality issues: 0",
