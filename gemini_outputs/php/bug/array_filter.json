  "response": "1. Category: BUG\n   Explanation: The `else` block overwrites the `$result` array with the current value `$val`. This means if any value in the array is not greater than the limit, the function will return only that single value instead of filtering the array correctly.\n   Why it’s a problem: It does not correctly filter the array based on the provided limit.\n   How to fix it: Remove the `else` block or modify it to not overwrite the entire `$result` array. The `else` block should probably have been empty or perform a different action. A simple fix is to remove the else part completely.\n\n2. Category: QUALITY\n   Explanation: The variable name `$arr` is not descriptive.\n   Why it’s a problem: It makes the code harder to understand.\n   How to fix it: Rename `$arr` to something like `$inputArray` or `$numbers`.\n\n3. Category: QUALITY\n   Explanation: The variable name `$val` is not descriptive.\n   Why it’s a problem: It makes the code harder to understand.\n   How to fix it: Rename `$val` to something like `$number` or `$value`.\n\n4. Category: QUALITY\n   Explanation: The function lacks proper documentation or comments explaining its purpose, parameters, and return value.\n   Why it’s a problem: It makes the code harder to understand and maintain.\n   How to fix it: Add a docblock comment above the function definition explaining its purpose, parameters, and return value.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 3",
