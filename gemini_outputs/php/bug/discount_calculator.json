Explanation: The discount calculation returns an incorrect value by adding the rate to the discounted price.\n    Why itâ€™s a problem: The function is supposed to calculate the price after the discount is applied, but adding the rate results in an inflated and incorrect final price.\n    How to fix it: Remove `+ $rate` from the return statement. The line should be `return $price - $discount;`\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n1. Explanation: The function name \"calculateDiscount\" is misleading.\n    Why it's a problem: The function doesn't just calculate the discount amount, it returns the final price after discount.\n    How to fix it: Rename the function to something like \"calculatePriceAfterDiscount\".\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n2. Explanation: Lack of input validation messages or exceptions.\n    Why it's a problem: When the rate is invalid (outside of 0-100 range) the function simply returns the original price. It would be beneficial to signal that the input was bad via an exception, logged message, or similar.\n    How to fix it: Throw an exception or log an error message if the rate is invalid.\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n3. Explanation: Using magic numbers.\n    Why it's a problem: Using the number 100 directly in the code makes it harder to understand and maintain.\n    How to fix it: Define a constant for 100, e.g., `const MAX_DISCOUNT_RATE = 100;` and use the constant instead.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 3",
