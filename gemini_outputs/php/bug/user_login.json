This means the if statement will always evaluate to true because it's assigning values to `$user` and `$pass` and then using the assigned value.\nWhy it’s a problem: The function will always return \"Success\" regardless of the input, making the login validation ineffective.\nHow to fix it: Replace the assignment operators `=` with equality operators `==`. The if statement should be: `if ($user == $validUser && $pass == $validPass)`\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n1. Explanation: Hardcoded credentials.\nWhy it’s a problem: Hardcoding credentials directly in the code is a major security vulnerability. If the code is compromised, the credentials are exposed.\nHow to fix it: Store credentials securely, such as in a database with proper hashing and salting, or in environment variables.\n\n2. Explanation: Lack of input validation and sanitization.\nWhy it’s a problem: The function doesn't validate or sanitize the input. This can lead to potential security issues like SQL injection if the function interacts with a database later on, or unexpected behavior if the inputs are of the wrong type.\nHow to fix it: Implement input validation and sanitization to ensure that the inputs are of the expected type and format, and to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.\n\n3. Explanation: The return values are strings \"Success\" and \"Fail\".\nWhy it's a problem: Using string literals for success/failure makes the code harder to use and less explicit. A boolean true/false is more standard and easier to reason about.\nHow to fix it: Return `true` for success and `false` for failure.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 3",
