This means that `$age` is being assigned the value `18`, and the result of the assignment (which is `18`, a truthy value) is being evaluated as the condition.\nWhy it’s a problem: The function will always return `true`, regardless of the input `age`.\nHow to fix it: Change the `if` statement to use the equality operator `==` or the strict equality operator `===`: `if ($age == 18)` or `if ($age === 18)`.\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n1. Explanation: The function name `isAdult` implies a boolean return value, but the code uses an `if-else` statement to explicitly return `true` or `false`.\nWhy it’s a problem: It's more verbose than necessary. The conditional expression itself can be directly returned.\nHow to fix it: Simplify the function to directly return the result of the comparison: `return $age >= 18;` or `return $age === 18;` depending on the intended logic.\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n2. Explanation: The function only checks if the age is exactly 18, not if it's 18 or older.\nWhy it’s a problem: The definition of an adult is generally someone who is 18 or older.\nHow to fix it: Change the comparison to `$age >= 18` to reflect the common understanding of adulthood. This also depends on the specific needs of the problem the code is trying to solve.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 2",
