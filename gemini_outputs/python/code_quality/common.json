This makes the code harder to understand and maintain.\nWhy it’s a problem: A descriptive function name improves code readability and maintainability.\nHow to fix it: Rename the function to something more specific, like `calculate_and_append_result`.\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n2. Explanation: The default value for the parameter `y` is a magic number (100).\nWhy it’s a problem: Magic numbers make the code less readable and harder to maintain. It's not clear what the number represents.\nHow to fix it: Define a constant with a descriptive name and use that as the default value. For example: `DEFAULT_Y = 100` and use `y=DEFAULT_Y`.\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n3. Explanation: The default value for `resultList` is a mutable object (a list).\nWhy it’s a problem: Mutable default arguments are created only once when the function is defined, not each time the function is called. This means that if the list is modified during one function call, the change will persist across subsequent calls, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.\nHow to fix it: Use `None` as the default value and create a new list inside the function if `resultList` is `None`. For example: `resultList=None` and then `if resultList is None: resultList = []`.\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n4. Explanation: The variable `temp` uses a magic number (3.14).\nWhy it’s a problem: Magic numbers make the code less readable and harder to maintain. It's not clear what the number represents.\nHow to fix it: Define a constant with a descriptive name (e.g., `PI = 3.14`) and use that in the calculation.\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n5. Explanation: The variable `unused` is defined but never used.\nWhy it’s a problem: Unused variables clutter the code and make it harder to read. They also might indicate a potential bug (the programmer intended to use the variable but forgot).\nHow to fix it: Remove the unused variable.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 5",
