Explanation:\n  - The function name \"proc_data\" is vague and doesn't clearly indicate what the function does.\n  - This makes the code harder to understand and maintain because a reader has to analyze the function's implementation to understand its purpose.\n  - A more descriptive name such as \"double_value\" or \"multiply_by_two\" would be better.\n2. Explanation:\n  - The variable name \"x\" is not descriptive.\n  - This makes the code harder to understand as the intended purpose of the variable is not clear.\n  - A more descriptive name such as \"input_value\" or \"number\" would be better.\n3. Explanation:\n  - The function lacks a docstring explaining its purpose, arguments, and return value.\n  - Without a docstring, it's harder to understand how to use the function, particularly for others who might use your code. It hinders reusability and maintainability.\n  - Add a docstring to explain what the function does. For example:\n\"\"\"\nDoubles the input value.\n\nArgs:\n    x: The number to be doubled.\n\nReturns:\n    The input value multiplied by 2.\n\"\"\"\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 3",
