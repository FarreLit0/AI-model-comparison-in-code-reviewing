  "response": "1. Category: BUG\n   - Explanation: The line `next_perm[i], next_perm[j] = perm[j], perm[i]` incorrectly uses `perm[j]` on the right-hand side instead of `next_perm[j]`.  This means the original `perm` list is being used to swap values into `next_perm`, instead of swapping values within the newly created `next_perm`.\n   - Why it’s a problem: It causes incorrect permutations to be generated. The value at index `j` in the original `perm` is used instead of the potentially modified value in `next_perm`, leading to wrong swaps and incorrect results.\n   - How to fix it: Change the line to `next_perm[i], next_perm[j] = next_perm[j], next_perm[i]`\n\n2. Category: QUALITY\n   - Explanation: The code creates a copy of the input list `perm` using `list(perm)` but also uses the original `perm` in the swap operation, which can be confusing.\n   - Why it’s a problem: It's slightly confusing and can increase the chance of errors, as evidenced by bug #1. It's generally cleaner and safer to work consistently with the copy.\n   - How to fix it: Ensure all operations that are meant to modify the permutation use the `next_perm` variable instead of the original `perm` list.\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 1",
