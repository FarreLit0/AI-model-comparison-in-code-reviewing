  "response": "1. Category: BUG\n   Explanation: The code modifies `perm` in place by assigning `perm[j]` to `next_perm[i]` while intending to swap. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the caller relies on the original `perm` remaining unchanged.\n   Why it’s a problem: It modifies the input perm unintentionally.\n   How to fix it: Use `next_perm[i], next_perm[j] = next_perm[j], next_perm[i]` instead of `next_perm[i], next_perm[j] = perm[j], perm[i]`.\n\n2. Category: BUG\n   Explanation: If the input `perm` is the last permutation in lexicographical order (i.e., it's in descending order), the code does not return anything. It should return None in this case, or handle the wraparound to the first permutation.\n   Why it’s a problem: The function does not handle the case when there is no next permutation.\n   How to fix it: Add a `return None` statement at the end of the function to handle this case.\n\n3. Category: QUALITY\n   Explanation: The code uses the variable name `perm`, which is short for permutation. While understandable, slightly more descriptive names improve readability.\n   Why it’s a problem: Less readable code.\n   How to fix it: Use a variable name like `permutation` or `sequence`.\n\n4. Category: QUALITY\n    Explanation: Creating `next_perm` as `list(perm)` might be a performance bottleneck if the input is very large. Although it's important for preventing in-place modification, we could also consider creating a copy at the very start instead if needed.\n    Why it’s a problem: Creates a copy for every operation which might not be desirable depending on size.\n    How to fix it: Create a copy initially or document the function's behaviour that a new copy is created\n\nTotal bugs: 2\nTotal quality issues: 2",
