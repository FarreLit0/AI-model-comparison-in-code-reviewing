Explanation: The function name `calcArea` uses camel case instead of snake case, which is the Python convention.\n   - Why it’s a problem: Violates Python's style guide (PEP 8) making the code look inconsistent with other Python code.\n   - How to fix it: Rename the function to `calculate_area`.\n\n2. Explanation: The magic number 3.14159 is used instead of `math.pi`.\n   - Why it’s a problem: Using a hardcoded value for pi is less accurate and makes the code less readable as it's not immediately clear what this number represents. It could also lead to inconsistencies if a different level of precision is required later.\n   - How to fix it: Import the `math` module and use `math.pi` instead.\n\n3. Explanation: The function lacks a docstring.\n   - Why it's a problem: Makes it difficult for others (or yourself later) to understand the purpose and usage of the function without reading the code.\n   - How to fix it: Add a docstring explaining the function's purpose, arguments, and return value.\n\nCategory: BUG\nThere are no bugs.\n\nTotal bugs: 0\nTotal quality issues: 3",
