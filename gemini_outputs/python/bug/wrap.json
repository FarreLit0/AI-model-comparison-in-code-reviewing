  "response": "Category: BUG\n1. Explanation: The final line of text is not appended to the `lines` list.\n    Why it’s a problem: The function doesn't return the complete wrapped text. It only returns the wrapped lines until the length of remaining text is less than or equal to cols, thus dropping the last line.\n    How to fix it: Add `lines.append(text)` after the `while` loop.\n\nCategory: BUG\n2. Explanation: If `end` is equal to `cols`, the remaining text begins with a space, which is bad.\n    Why it's a problem: Extra space in the beginning of the wrapped text lines.\n    How to fix it: Add `text = text[1:]` after `end = cols`.\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n1. Explanation: The function name `wrap` is not very descriptive.\n    Why it’s a problem: It’s not clear what the function does without reading the code.\n    How to fix it: Rename the function to something more descriptive, like `wrap_text`.\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n2. Explanation: The variable name `cols` is not very descriptive; `text` is acceptable but `lines` and `end` are fine.\n    Why it’s a problem: It is not clear what `cols` represents.\n    How to fix it: Rename `cols` to `max_line_length`.\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n3. Explanation: There are no docstrings.\n    Why it’s a problem: The function's purpose and parameters are unclear without reading the code.\n    How to fix it: Add a docstring explaining what the function does, what the parameters are, and what the return value is.\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n4. Explanation: The code could be made more readable by using more descriptive variable names and adding comments.\n    Why it’s a problem: It makes the code harder to understand at a glance.\n    How to fix it: Add comments to explain the logic, especially the `rfind` part.\n\nTotal bugs: 2\nTotal quality issues: 4",
