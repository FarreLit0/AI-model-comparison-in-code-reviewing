Explanation: Division by zero is not handled.\n   - What the issue is: The code doesn't check for division by zero in the `op` function.\n   - Why it’s a problem: Dividing by zero results in a `ZeroDivisionError`, causing the program to crash.\n   - How to fix it: Add a check for `b == 0` within the division case in the `op` function, and raise an exception or return an appropriate value (e.g., infinity or an error message).\n\n2. Explanation: Insufficient operands on the stack.\n   - What the issue is: The code assumes there will always be two operands on the stack when an operator is encountered.\n   - Why it’s a problem: If the RPN expression is invalid and has too many operators or not enough operands, the `stack.pop()` calls will raise an `IndexError`.\n   - How to fix it: Check the stack length before popping elements. If the stack has fewer than two elements, it indicates an invalid expression, and an exception should be raised or an appropriate error value returned.\n\n3. Explanation: Incorrect operand order.\n    - What the issue is: The operands `a` and `b` are popped in the wrong order for non-commutative operations like subtraction and division.\n    - Why it's a problem: In RPN, the order of operands matters. The last pushed operand should be the right operand, and the second to last pushed operand should be the left operand. The current code effectively calculates `b - a` instead of `a - b` and `b / a` instead of `a / b`.\n    - How to fix it: Reverse the order when calling the `op` function: `op(token, b, a)`.\n\nCategory: QUALITY\n1. Explanation: Unnecessary lambda functions in `op`.\n   - What the issue is: The `op` function uses lambda functions unnecessarily.\n   - Why it's a problem: It reduces readability and adds an extra layer of indirection.\n   - How to fix it: Directly define the operation functions instead of wrapping them in lambdas. For example, use `'+': add` after importing the `add` operator.\n\n2. Explanation: Missing type validation.\n   - What the issue is: The code only checks for `float` type for operands but doesn't explicitly handle other numeric types like integers. It also assumes that the `token` will be either an operator or a number.\n   - Why it's a problem: If the input contains non-numeric types where a number is expected, the code will fail or give incorrect results.\n   - How to fix it: Use `isinstance(token, (int, float))` or try converting the token to a float within a try-except block and handle the `ValueError` if the conversion fails.\n\n3. Explanation: Lack of error handling for invalid operators.\n    - What the issue is: If the input contains an operator that is not '+', '-', '*', or '/', a `KeyError` will be raised when accessing the `op` dictionary.\n    - Why it's a problem: The program will crash when encountering an invalid operator.\n    - How to fix it: Add a check within the `op` function or before calling it to ensure the operator is valid, and raise an exception or return an error value if it's not.\n\n4. Explanation: Lack of comments and docstrings.\n    - What the issue is: The code lacks comments and a docstring explaining its purpose, arguments, and return value.\n    - Why it's a problem: It reduces readability and makes it harder to understand and maintain the code.\n    - How to fix it: Add a docstring at the beginning of the function explaining what it does, what arguments it takes, and what it returns. Add comments to clarify complex logic or non-obvious steps.\n\n5. Explanation: Single character variable names.\n    - What the issue is: The code uses single-character variable names like `a` and `b`.\n    - Why it's a problem: It reduces readability and makes it harder to understand the code's intent.\n    - How to fix it: Use more descriptive variable names like `operand1` and `operand2`.\n\n6. Explanation: No handling for empty input.\n    - What the issue is: If the input `tokens` is empty, the code will still attempt to execute, potentially leading to errors.\n    - Why it's a problem: The program may crash or return unexpected results when given an empty input.\n    - How to fix it: Add a check at the beginning of the function to handle empty input by returning a default value, raising an exception, or taking other appropriate actions.\n\nTotal bugs: 3\nTotal quality issues: 6",
