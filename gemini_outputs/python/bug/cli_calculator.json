  "response": "1. Category: BUG\n   Explanation: Division by zero is not handled. If the user enters '/' and the second number (y) is 0, the code will raise a ZeroDivisionError and crash.\n   Why it’s a problem: Causes the program to terminate unexpectedly.\n   How to fix it: Add a check to see if y is zero before performing the division and display an error message if it is.\n\n2. Category: QUALITY\n   Explanation: The function doesn't return a value. While it prints the result, it doesn't allow the result to be used by other parts of the program.\n   Why it’s a problem: Limits the reusability and flexibility of the function.\n   How to fix it: Instead of printing the result, return it. Also, change the print statements in the else block to also return appropriate messages for consistent behavior.\n\n3. Category: QUALITY\n   Explanation: Lack of input validation. The code assumes the user will enter valid numbers and a valid operator. If the user enters something that cannot be converted to a float, a ValueError will occur.\n   Why it’s a problem: Can lead to program crashes or unexpected behavior.\n   How to fix it: Use try-except blocks to handle potential ValueErrors when converting the input to floats.\n\n4. Category: QUALITY\n   Explanation: The function name \"calculate\" is too generic. It doesn't clearly indicate what kind of calculation it performs (arithmetic operations).\n   Why it’s a problem: Reduces readability and makes it harder to understand the function's purpose at a glance.\n   How to fix it: Rename the function to something more specific, such as \"perform_arithmetic_operation\" or \"simple_calculator.\"\n\nTotal bugs: 1\nTotal quality issues: 3",
